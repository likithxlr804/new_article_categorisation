The court is back in session after a lunch break and opening statements are expected to begin soon in the historic defamation lawsuit brought by election technology company Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News.

Here’s what you need to know about the high-stakes case:

Why is Dominion suing Fox News? Dominion sued Fox News in 2021 over the right-wing network’s repeated promotion of false claims about the company, including that its voting machines rigged the 2020 election by flipping millions of ballots from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. Most of the 20 allegedly defamatory broadcasts mentioned in the lawsuit occurred in November and December 2020.

The company alleges that people at Fox News acted with actual malice and “recklessly disregarded the truth” when they spread this disinformation about Dominion. To prove “actual malice,” Dominion must convince a jury that people at Fox News who were responsible for these 20 broadcasts knew the Dominion claims were false or recklessly disregarded evidence of falsity — but put them on-air anyway.

According to Dominion’s theory of the case, Fox promoted these election conspiracy theories because “the lies were good for Fox’s business.” Dominion’s suit specifically zeroed in on shows hosted by Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Jeanine Pirro. Dominion said that as a result of Fox’s “orchestrated defamatory campaign” it has suffered “enormous and irreparable economic harm” and that its employees have been subjected to death threats and harassment.

What is Fox’s defense? Fox said it didn’t defame anyone and that the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms.

A spokesperson for Fox has said the network “is proud of our 2020 election coverage” and that its coverage “stands in the highest tradition of American journalism.” The company said, “Dominion’s lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished First Amendment rights.”

Fox has also accused Dominion of generating “noise and confusion” around the case, stating, “the core of this case remains about freedom of the press and freedom of speech, which are fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution,” specifically the First Amendment.

Fox has attempted to get the lawsuit tossed. But in a major blow to the right-wing network last month, the judge overseeing the case has allowed it to go to trial. He has also prohibited Fox from invoking some key First Amendment defenses, finding they were without merit.

What is Dominion asking for? Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages. They say Fox’s on-air lies destroyed its reputation and is causing election officials to cancel their Dominion contracts. CNN recently reported on the growing distrust in voting machines in heavily Republican counties.

What are the trial logistics? The trial is expected to last five to six weeks and will be overseen by Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric M. Davis, who was appointed to the state bench in 2012 by a Democratic governor. A panel of 12 jurors and 12 alternates is being seated.

Cameras are not allowed in the courtroom and there will not be any video of the proceedings. There also won’t be any still photography inside the courtroom.

Who is expected to testify? Expected witness include Fox Corporation executives Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch; Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and president Jay Wallace; prominent TV hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Maria Bartiromo, Lou Dobbs, Jeanine Pirro, and Bret Baier, among others.

Dominion said it might also call Viet Dinh, Fox’s chief legal officer, and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Fox board member, to the witness stand.

Both sides are also hoping to put on testimony from their handpicked experts who specialize in election statistics, the security of voting machines, journalism ethics, the impact of disinformation in public discourse, and more.

2,Here are the 20 specific Fox broadcasts and tweets Dominion says were defamatory,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/media/dominion-fox-news-allegations/index.html,"CNN —

For all the interest in big-name witnesses and eye-opening private text messages, at the core of the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News are 20 specific broadcasts and tweets in which the voting company says Fox knowingly promoted lies, destroying its reputation.

According to the lawsuit, all 20 statements took place between November 8, 2020, and January 26, 2021, and came in the form of on-air comments from Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo; interviews with prominent pro-Trump election deniers Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell; and several of Dobbs’ tweets.

The wild allegations in the statements fell into four broad categories: that Dominion conducted election fraud, that it used algorithms to flip votes, that it had ties to Venezuela and that politicians received kickbacks to use the company.

The judge overseeing the defamation trial has already ruled that these allegations were false, saying it is “CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.”

At trial, it will be a jury’s job to determine if the statements were made with “actual malice” – a high bar based on knowing falseness or having a reckless disregard for the truth – and potentially award damages. Dominion has asked for $1.6 billion in damages and additional punitive damages, a number Fox says is wildly overblown.

Fox has denied wrongdoing and said the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. Lawyers for Fox have argued that Dominion hasn’t come close to clearing the high bar to prove defamation.

Here’s a closer look at those 20 specific broadcasts and tweets of alleged defamation.

What they alleged: Election fraud and algorithm flips.

Key false quote: “Sidney, we talked about the Dominion software. I know that there were voting irregularities. Tell me about that,” Bartiromo said.

“That’s to put it mildly. The computer glitches could not and should not have happened at all,” Powell said. “That is where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.”

“Well, I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion, starting with the fact it was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for Hugo Chavez and then shipped internationally to manipulate votes for purchase in other countries, including this one,” Powell said.

“We also need to look at and we’re beginning to collect evidence on the financial interests of some of the governors and Secretaries of State who actually bought into the Dominion Systems … to line their own pockets by getting a voting machine in that would either make sure their election was successful or they got money for their family from it,” she added.

“Well, that’s straightforward,” Dobbs said. “You’re going to have to be quick to go through and to produce that investigation and the results of it.”

3,Judge in Fox News-Dominion defamation trial: 'The parties have resolved their case',https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/media/fox-dominion-settlement/index.html,"Wilmington, Delaware CNN —

Fox News reached a last-second settlement with Dominion Voting Systems on Tuesday as the case raced toward opening statements, paying more than $787 million to end a colossal two-year legal battle that publicly shredded the right-wing network’s credibility.

Fox News’ $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems is the largest publicly known defamation settlement in US history involving a media company.

The deal was announced hours after the jury was sworn in at the Delaware Superior Court. Rumors of a settlement swirled in the courthouse when, after a lunch break, the proceedings dramatically ground to a halt for nearly three hours with no explanation, while the parties apparently hammered out an accord.

“The parties have resolved their case,” Judge Eric Davis said, before dismissing the 12-member jury, crediting them with giving the parties an impetus to reach a settlement, effusively praising the lawyers from both sides, and gaveling out the so-called media “trial of the century” before it could even begin.

The groundbreaking settlement “represents vindication and accountability,” Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said. “For our democracy to endure for another 250 years, and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts… Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy.”

The right-wing network said in a statement that it “acknowledge[s] the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” referring to Davis’ recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. But Fox won’t have to admit on-air that it spread lies about Dominion, a Dominion representative told CNN.

The $787.5 million payout is roughly half of the $1.6 billion that Dominion initially sought, though it is nearly 10 times the company’s valuation from 2018, and roughly eight times its annual revenue in 2021, according to court filings.

Fox avoids painful six-week trial

The last-minute agreement means the closely watched case is over and won’t proceed to trial. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud.

The witness list included Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, his CEO son Lachlan Murdoch, and top Fox hosts like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. Damning emails, texts, and deposition testimony made public during the case revealed that these figures, and many others at Fox, privately said in 2020 that the vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. But the lies were spread on-air anyway.

Rupert Murdoch thought the election denialism was “really crazy,” even as Fox personalities peddled those same claims to millions of viewers. Carlson said he “passionately” hates Donald Trump, whose presidency was a “disaster.” Fox hosts, producers, fact-checkers, and senior executives privately said in the on-air claims of a stolen election were “kooky,” “dangerously reckless” and “mind-blowingly nuts.”

These revelations generated months of blistering headlines for Fox as the case moved toward trial. By settling now, Fox deprived Dominion a chance to further expose its dishonesty with a weeks-long trial.

“This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards,” Fox said in a statement Tuesday. “We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”

Fox News and Fox Corporation – its parent company, which was also a defendant – maintain they never defamed Dominion, and say the case was a meritless assault on First Amendment press freedoms.

Dramatic days in Delaware

Speculation of a settlement reached a fever pitch in recent days, especially after the court on Sunday announced a one-day delay to the start of the trial, which was originally set to begin on Monday.

The jury selection process wrapped up as planned Tuesday morning, and both sides prepped for opening statements. They even briefly tangled over objections to specific slides in their presentations. But when the proceedings didn’t promptly resume after lunch, the chances of a deal seemed to rise by the minute, even though the top lawyers from both sides sat in the courtroom, looking at their phones, and waiting.

The racially diverse jury of six men and six women was brought back into the court, ready for their front-row seat to a historic trial. But Davis, the judge, instead told the panel they helped spur a settlement.

“Your presence here, short compared to what you thought, and uneventful in a certain sense, was extremely important,” Davis said. “Without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation.”

Many on the Dominion side cast the settlement as a victory for democracy and for truth itself.

“Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,” Dominion CEO John Poulos said Tuesday outside court.

While the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was similarly smeared on Fox News’ shows after the 2020 election. That case is still in the discovery process, and a trial isn’t expected anytime soon.

For its part, Dominion still has pending lawsuits against right-wing TV networks Newsmax and OAN, as well as against Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell. They all deny wrongdoing.

5,Millions in the US could face massive consequences unless McCarthy can navigate out of a debt trap he set for Biden,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/politics/mccarthy-biden-debt-ceiling/index.html,"CNN —

Millions of Americans could face massive consequences unless Speaker Kevin McCarthy can navigate out of a debt trap he has set for President Joe Biden that is instead threatening to capture his House Republicans.

The California Republican traveled to Wall Street on Monday to deliver a fresh warning that the House GOP majority will refuse to lift a cap on government borrowing unless Biden agrees to spending cuts that would effectively neutralize his domestic agenda and neuter his White House legacy.

McCarthy also assured traders, however, that he would never let the US government default on its obligations – a potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger a recession and unleash job cuts by the fall in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised.

This is where the risk to Americans comes in. It’s hard to see how a rookie speaker, with a tiny majority and a conference containing plenty of extremists, can engineer either of these outcomes.

Most countries don’t require the legislature to raise the government’s borrowing threshold. But the quirky situation in the US has made a once routine duty an opportunity for political mischief in a polarized age. Since the government spends more than it makes in revenue, it must borrow money to service its debt and pay for spending that Congress has already authorized. It has no problem getting more credit since the US pays its bills and has always had a stellar credit rating, despite one previous downgrade from the threat of default.

At least, that’s the way it has worked until now.

McCarthy beseeched his conference in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to line up behind a bill that would raise the debt limit for a year but require a flurry of spending concessions from Biden. He styled the measure as an initial way of forcing the president to the negotiating table. But the bill is purely tactical since it’s got no chance of passing the Democratic-led Senate.

But in a sign of how difficult it will be for the speaker to even pull this gambit off, there were signs of internal disagreement on what should be in the package among GOP members.

Rep. Scott Perry, the chairman of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, was frustrated about a lack of specificity in the plan and wanted steeper cuts.

“I don’t know what’s in the package completely. That’s the issue,” Perry told reporters. Some members seem reluctant to commit so far. Conservative Rep. Tim Burchett told CNN’s Manu Raju, “I’m open to it but I’m still a ‘no’ vote.”

It is not unusual for various factions in a congressional majority to haggle over details before a final package is agreed. And House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry, a McCarthy ally, was confident the plan would pass the House. “The question is, what does the White House then do once we pass this package? We’ve clearly stated there is no clean debt ceiling that will pass the House,” he added. “So we’ll have the first opening offer here. And we’ll see if the president’s willing to come to the table and negotiate like previous presidents have.”

McHenry’s comment, however, reflected a big flaw in the GOP strategy since it relies on McCarthy’s belief that Biden will have no choice but to come to the table. The White House has insisted the House should do its job and pass a simple bill that only raises the borrowing limit

In effect, McCarthy has already set up a severe test of his leadership since there’s no guarantee that he can pass the measure in a House where he can only lose four votes and in which there are few signs the fractious GOP can agree on what programs to cut and by how much. And even if the measure does squeeze through the House in the coming weeks, it will likely be an idealized Republican product on which Biden and the Democratic Senate will never bite. Any subsequent package that emerged would almost certainly feature concessions that could splinter its GOP support.

Still, the speaker was typically bullish when he predicted Monday he’d have the votes to pass his initial bill.

“I think we got 218 to raise the debt ceiling,” McCarthy told CNN. “We’ve got a lot of consensus within the conference. We’ll get together and work through it.”

His assurances may not be very reassuring, however, because his similarly blithe predictions that he had the votes to win the speakership in January degenerated into a farcical process that saw him make huge concessions to his party’s most radical members and required 15 ballots before he finally won the job of his dreams.

But with the debt ceiling, it will be Americans’ livelihoods and the global economy, rather than McCarthy’s immediate political ambitions, that are on the line.

Republicans are yet to agree on their own demands

So far, Republicans seem to be having trouble negotiating with themselves, let alone Biden. Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, who is helping to fashion the GOP’s position, said that while the party hopes to pass the initial bill next week, challenges remain.

“I think the hardest part is just that there are an unlimited number of conservative policy victories that, of course, we all want to see worked in,” Johnson told CNN’s Manu Raju. “The reality is that in a negotiation, you never get everything you want. And so I think our biggest issue right now is how do we squeeze these thousands of desires down to a manageable and credible number of asks?”

Another complication is that some members of the Republican conference have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling on principle – no matter what. In a powerful Republican majority such holdouts could be ignored. In McCarthy’s narrow majority – secured after a 2022 midterm election that fell short of GOP expectations – they have real leverage. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since they’d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill. And the speaker probably couldn’t risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule, as he battled to win his job, that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster.

The coming showdown over the debt ceiling is potentially the defining moment in the two-year period of uneasy cohabitation between the Democratic president and Republican speaker. Neither Biden nor McCarthy can afford to lose, and the outcome will shape both their legacies.

Republicans may have less leverage than they think

There is nothing wrong with Republicans seeking to use the leverage they won in a democratic election to try to further their political goals of cutting public spending. There are some GOP lawmakers who sincerely worry about debt and deficits – even when their party runs government. Plenty of economists worry about the always ballooning national debt, which has crashed through $31 trillion. And Biden’s big spending on Covid relief packages, infrastructure, climate mitigation measures and health care programs triggered a debate on whether he worsened the inflation crisis.

But are Republicans choosing the right hill for this battle when jobs, market-linked pension plans and the economic well-being of millions are at risk? The absolutist nature of McCarthy’s position pays little heed to a delicate balance of power. Democrats control the White House and the Senate, so in handing Republicans the House, albeit barely, voters might have been seeking compromise rather than confrontation.

Republicans are also facing claims of hypocrisy, since they had little problem raising the debt limit when Donald Trump, who rarely worried about making a big spending splash, was president. The 45th commander in chief is also on videotape dating to his White House days saying he couldn’t believe anyone would use the debt ceiling as a “negotiating wedge.” Republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when Democrats are in office but often look the other way when there is one of their own in the Oval Office.

McCarthy needs to reverse the blame equation

In order to prevail in this fight, McCarthy has to somehow change the political dynamic by saddling Biden with the blame for any default and the economic tensions that could begin to unfold even before the country plunges over a fiscal cliff.

He tried to do so on Monday by insisting that the biggest threat to the US economy wasn’t a default but rising national debt.

“Without exaggeration American debt is a ticking time bomb that will detonate unless we take serious responsible action. Yet, how has President Biden reacted to this issue? He has done nothing. So in my view, and I think the rest of America, it’s irresponsible,” he said.

Previous fiscal showdowns between GOP-controlled Congresses and Democratic presidents have often rebounded poorly on Republicans. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, for example, branded their foes in the House as economic arsonists and thereby gained political traction.

McCarthy needs to reverse the equation, which is why he’s trying to portray Biden as stubborn in refusing to negotiate concessions for raising the debt ceiling. The two men haven’t met for the last 75 days and the White House is sticking to its position that the place for talks is over a budget – which House Republicans are yet to produce – and not with the full faith and credit of the US government on the line and with America’s reputation as a financial haven at stake.

McCarthy is, therefore, in a bind. Congress, not the president, has the power to raise the government’s borrowing limit. Yet the speaker is demanding Biden give away his store over a duty that only McCarthy and his lawmakers can fulfill. No one would benefit from a default – especially not a president likely heading into a reelection race. But it’s hard to see how McCarthy can emerge from this conundrum as the winner if he triggers an economic meltdown.

The White House twisted that particular knife on Monday.

“There is one responsible solution to the debt limit: addressing it promptly, without brinksmanship or hostage taking – as Republicans did three times in the last administration and as Presidents Trump and Reagan argued for in office,” spokesman Andrew Bates said.

Republicans in the Senate have so far tried to avoid the mess. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell did at least give his colleague in the House some moral support on Monday when he returned to the Capitol after convalescing after a fall.

“President Biden does not get to stick his fingers in his ears and refuse to listen, talk or negotiate. And the American people know that. The White House needs to stop wasting time and start negotiating with the Speaker of the House,” McConnell said, though notably didn’t volunteer to get involved.

McCarthy’s speech on Monday only furthered the impression that a damaging political crisis over the debt ceiling is, after months of simmering, moving toward a boil.

6,White homeowner accused of shooting a Black teen who rang his doorbell turns himself in to face criminal charges,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/us/kansas-city-ralph-yarl-shooting-tuesday/index.html,"CNN —

The 84-year-old White man accused of shooting a Black teenager who rang his doorbell in Kansas City turned himself in Tuesday and was later released on bail, authorities said.

Andrew Lester, who faces two felony charges – assault in the first degree and armed criminal action – in the April 13 shooting of Ralph Yarl, will be arraigned Wednesday afternoon, according to Yarl family attorney Lee Merritt. CNN has reached out to prosecutors to confirm the information.

Lester turned himself in at a detention center Tuesday then hours later was released on bail. The conditions of his $200,000 bond prohibit him from having any type of weapon and cannot have direct or indirect contact with Yarl or his family, according to Clay County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Sarah Boyd.

Ralph, 16, was shot in the head and arm after he went to the wrong address to pick up his siblings. He has been released from a hospital but faces an arduous road to recovery, his family said.

Lester has told police he and the teen did not exchange words before he fired at him through a locked glass door.

CNN has not been able to reach the homeowner. CNN has yet to determine whether Lester has an attorney.

The criminal charges have brought a bit of comfort to Ralph’s family – but long roads lie ahead, both with Ralph’s recovery and the quest for justice, his aunt Faith Spoonmore told CNN.

“It’s not as simple as turning a page,” Spoonmore said Tuesday. “It’s a little better that he is – hopefully – going to get part of what of he deserves.”

But questions remain over why Lester was initially detained but released a few hours after the April 13 shooting.

“I share the outrage and concern of many in asking why,” Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told CNN.

“In Missouri, you can have a 24-hour hold. It is clear here that this was two or three hours, where they questioned the suspect. He was able to go back home that evening.”

Lester told police he fired immediately after answering the doorbell when he saw Ralph pulling on an exterior door handle, according to the probable cause document obtained by CNN.

Lester thought Ralph was trying to break in to the home and was “scared to death” due to the boy’s size, according to the document.

Officers responded just before 10 p.m. that night after receiving reports of a shooting. When they arrived, they found Ralph wounded in the street.

The shooting left Ralph, who plays bass clarinet and is a band leader in school, with gunshot wounds to his head and arm. While he was hospitalized, Ralph told police he did not pull on the door, according to the document.

It was “nothing short of a miracle” that Ralph was discharged from the hospital, his attorney Ben Crump told CNN on Monday. But “he’s not out of the woods yet.”

The shooting fueled protests in Kansas City and stirred memories of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery – young Black males who were shot and killed by men who later claimed self-defense.

Demonstrators have marched through Kansas City chanting, “Justice for Ralph,” and calling for the shooter’s arrest.

The shooting also came days before a 20-year-old woman was shot and killed in upstate New York after she and three others accidentally turned into the wrong driveway.

While Ralph’s attorneys say the teen never posed a threat to his shooter, it remains unclear whether Missouri’s “stand your ground” law will be cited in Lester’s defense case.

“Stand your ground” laws allow people to respond to threats or force without fear of criminal prosecution in any place where a person has the right to be.

Ralph’s aunt challenged the notion that her nephew’s “size” could be a threat.

“I really don’t understand how,” Spoonmore said. “I doubt Ralph is even 170 pounds. Ralph is not even 6 feet (tall).”

She said she’s on a mission to help get justice for her nephew.

“I want justice to look the same across the board,” Spoonmore said. “I want justice to look the same.”

‘A racial component to this case’

The mayor said he believes Ralph was racially profiled by the shooter.

“This boy was shot because he was existing while Black,” Lucas said.

Clay County Prosecuting Attorney Zachary Thompson has said, “There was a racial component to this case,” but did not elaborate.

On the night of the shooting, Lester was taken into custody and was released less than two hours later, two representatives at the Kansas City Police Department detention unit previously told CNN.

Lester was released because police recognized that more investigative work needed to be done, Thompson said.

Attorney Crump questioned why Lester was not detained longer.

“Nobody can tell us if the roles were reversed, and you had a Black man shoot a White 16-year-old teenager for merely ringing his doorbell that he would not be arrested. I mean, this citizen went home and slept in his bed at night after shooting that young Black kid in the head,” Crump told CNN.

“He merely rang the doorbell. That was it,” the teen’s attorney said. “And the owner of the home shoots through the door, hitting him in the head and then shoots him a second time.”

The mayor said he didn’t even know the details of the case until several days after the shooting. And while he believes race played a role in the shooting, he acknowledged the work by police – including White officers – who helped prosecutors file charges against Lester.

“We did have officers, White officers for what it’s worth, who did a lot of hard work to get this case file to the prosecutor having charges filed shortly thereafter,” Lucas said.

“That being said, to pretend that race is not a part of this whole situation would be to have your head in the sand.”

How the shooting unfolded

Before the shooting, Lester was lying down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring and picked up his .32 caliber revolver, he told police, according to a probable cause statement.

He then went to his home’s front entrance, which includes an interior door and a glass exterior door – both of which were locked.

Lester opened the interior door and “saw a black male approximately 6 feet tall pulling on the exterior storm door handle,” Lester told police.

“He stated he believed someone was attempting to break into the house, and shot twice within a few seconds of opening the door,” the probable cause statement reads.

“He believed he was protecting himself from a physical confrontation and could not take the chance of the male coming in,” the document reads.

Lester said he immediately called 911 after the shooting, according to the document.

Police spoke with Ralph while he was being treated at a hospital, where he told them his mother asked him to pick up his brothers at 1100 NE 115th Street, according to the document, which notes the actual address they were staying at was 1100 NE 115th Terrace.

When he arrived at the house on 115th Street, Ralph said he rang the doorbell and waited a while before a man eventually opened the door and immediately shot him in the head, causing him to fall, the document says.

While the teenager was still on the ground, the man then fired again, shooting him in the arm, Ralph told police.

Ralph said he got up and ran to keep from being shot, and he heard the man say, “Don’t come around here,” the document says. He then went to multiple nearby homes asking for help and telling people to call police.

The boy told police he did not pull on the door, according to the probable cause document.

Responding officers also found the front storm door glass at Lester’s home broken, with blood on the front porch and the driveway, according to the document.

The teen “had to run to 3 different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up,” a GoFundMe page started by Ralph’s aunt states.

A neighbor, who asked not to be identified, told CNN she called 911 after Ralph came to her door, bleeding.

Since the shooter’s location was unknown at the time, she was directed to stay inside her home by the emergency operator for her safety. She said she complied initially, then went outside with towels to help suppress the bleeding.

“This is somebody’s child. I had to clean blood off of my door, off of my railing. That was someone’s child’s blood,” she said. “I’m a mom … this is not OK.”

‘You can’t profile and shoot our children’

Ralph is still traumatized from the ordeal, but the family hopes for a full recovery because Ralph is young and strong, Crump said.

“He and his family are just happy that he’s alive after being shot in the head,” Crump told CNN.

Merritt said Tuesday the first bullet traveled less than five feet into Yarl’s upper temple and penetrated his skull.

“They scraped bullet fragments off his frontal lobe on Thursday. On Saturday he was home playing with his dog,” Merritt said.

He said God was telling the community and its leaders they cannot go on as business usual.

“That was in fact a miracle. What are we supposed to learn from that miracle, is the question we need to answer.”

Ralph, a section leader in a marching band who could often be found with an instrument in hand, had been looking forward to graduating from high school and visiting West Africa before starting college, according to the GoFundMe page.

“Life looks a lot different right now. Even though he is doing well physically, he has a long road ahead mentally and emotionally. The trauma that he has to endure and survive is unimaginable,” the aunt wrote in the fundraiser.

The GoFundMe page, started to help the family with medical expenses, had garnered more than $2 million in donations by Monday night.

Crump likened Ralph’s shooting to the shootings of 17-year-old Martin in Florida and 25-year-old Arbery in Georgia.

“We continue to fight to say you can’t profile and shoot our children, just because you have this ‘stand your ground’ law,” Crump said. “Unacceptable.”

Merritt told CNN Monday that the “stand your ground” action would not apply to Ralph’s case.

“The stand your ground action, under the laws of Missouri, are completely inapplicable to this case, because there has been no conversation, not from the suspect, not from the victim and not from law enforcement, that Ralph Yarl, at 16 years old, ever posed a threat to this shooter,” Merritt said.

President chats with teen and mother

President Joe Biden spoke with Ralph and his mother, Cleo Nagbe, by phone on Monday evening, a White House official told CNN.

Biden also noted how “fortunate” Ralph is that his mother is not just a nurse, but also a physical therapist.

The conversation also covered their families, their love of music and Ralph’s dream of pursuing a chemical engineering degree at Texas A&M University – to which Biden “lightheartedly attempted to convince him that (the president’s alma mater) University of Delaware was a much better option,” the official said.

“The president also committed to keeping up his fight against gun violence,” the official said.",2023-04-19 04:29:05,Entertainment

It’s sourdough bread and handstands for Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Lee Curtis.

The two stars are talking about the time they spent together during the Covid-19 pandemic, telling People that the actor, who is Lee’s godson, and his girlfriend Jeanne Cadieu, lived in the house next door that Curtis owns. Curtis, who won best supporting actress Oscar at lthe 2023 Academy Awards, is friends with Gyllenhaal’s parents, director Stephen Gyllenhaal and screenwriter Naomi Foner.

“We’ve just gotten to know each other,” Lee said while at the premiere of Gyllenhaal’s new thriller “The Covenant.” “He also lived with me during Covid for almost a year. He and Jeanne lived in the house next door that I have. And so there was also that. For a minute.”

Lee revealed that Gyllenhaal, like a lot of people, turned to bread baking during the time, and would act and sing and do handstands for the small group.

“He made a lot of sourdough bread, a lot,” Lee said. “So singing, acting, sourdough. And he did that test where you do a handstand against the wall and take your shirt off and put it back on.”

Gyllenhaal added the bread baking has stuck.

“I am still eating sourdough,” he said. “Yes. I haven’t stopped. Even though we’re out of the pandemic, I am still making sourdough.”

Gyllenhaal’s new film is a military thriller directed by Guy Ritchie. It also stars Alexander Ludwig, Antony Starr, Bobby Schofield and Jonny Lee Miller.",2023-04-18 14:40:32,Entertainment

Jamie Foxx remains hospitalized in Georgia nearly a week after his daughter revealed the actor experienced a “medical complication,” a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN on Monday.

His daughter Corinne Foxx shared on Instagram last week that her father had experienced a health-related incident last Tuesday, though she did not specify what occurred. She added in her post that due to “quick action and great care,” her father is “on his way to recovery.”

CNN reported Friday that Foxx was hospitalized and undergoing medical tests.

Foxx has been in Atlanta filming the Netflix movie “Back in Action” with Cameron Diaz. The source previously told CNN that the medical incident did not happen on set and Foxx was not transported by emergency vehicle to the hospital.

A separate source close to production on the film told CNN on Friday that filming is “currently underway” and is expected to wrap up this week.

This source did not elaborate as to whether Foxx still has scenes to film or whether he would be back on set.

A 13-year-old in Ohio has died after “he took a bunch of Benadryl,” trying a dangerous TikTok challenge that’s circulating online, according to a CNN affiliate and a GoFundMe account from his family.

Jacob Stevens was participating in a TikTok challenge with some friends at home when he ingested the antihistamine, the family donation account states. Jacob was on a ventilator for almost a week before he died, according to WSYX.

CNN has not independently confirmed his cause of death.

Overdosing on Benadryl can result in “serious heart problems, seizures, coma, or even death,” the US Food and Drug Administration said in a 2020 warning to the public about the deadly “Benadryl Challenge” on TikTok.

Jacob’s grandmother is doing anything she can “to make sure another child doesn’t go through” with the challenge, she told CNN affiliate WSYX.

In a statement to CNN, TikTok said, “Our deepest sympathies go out to the family. At TikTok, we strictly prohibit and remove content that promotes dangerous behavior with the safety of our community as a priority. We have never seen this type of content trend on our platform and have blocked searches for years to help discourage copycat behavior. Our team of 40,000 safety professionals works to remove violations of our Community Guidelines and we encourage our community to report any content or accounts they’re concerned about.”

The maker of Benadryl, Johnson & Johnson, has called the challenge “dangerous.”

“We understand that consumers may have heard about an online ‘challenge’ involving the misuse or abuse of diphenhydramine,” the undated online statement reads.

“The challenge, which involves ingestion of excessive quantities of diphenhydramine, is a dangerous trend and should be stopped immediately. BENADRYL® products and other diphenhydramine products should only be used as directed by the label.”

“We are working with TikTok and other social platforms to remove content that showcases this behavior,” the statement added. “We will look to partner across industry and with key stakeholders to address this dangerous behavior.”

CNN has reached out to the Stevens family and Columbus Public Health for comment.

The FDA’s 2020 warning said the agency had “contacted TikTok and strongly urged them to remove the videos from their platform and to be vigilant to remove additional videos that may be posted.”

Benadryl is an antihistamine used to treat symptoms such as a runny nose or sneezing from upper respiratory allergies, hay fever or the common cold. It’s safe and effective when used as recommended, the FDA said.

“Diphenhydramine is marketed under the brand-name Benadryl, store brands, and generics. It is also available in combination with pain relievers, fever reducers, and decongestants,” the agency said.

Consumers and parents should store Benadryl and other over-the-counter medications and prescription medicines out of the reach of children, the FDA said.",2023-04-19 15:01:06,Business

14,FTC chair Lina Khan warns AI could 'turbocharge' fraud and scams,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/tech/lina-khan-ai-warning/index.html,"Washington CNN —

Artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT could lead to a “turbocharging” of consumer harms including fraud and scams, and the US government has substantial authority to crack down on AI-driven consumer harms under existing law, members of the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday.

Addressing House lawmakers, FTC chair Lina Khan said the “turbocharging of fraud and scams that could be enabled by these tools are a serious concern.”

In recent months, a new crop of AI tools have gained attention for their ability to generate convincing emails, stories and essays as well as images, audio and videos. While these tools have potential to change the way people work and create, some have also raised concerns about how they could be use to deceive by impersonating individuals.

Even as policymakers across the federal government debate how to promote specific AI rules, citing concerns about possible algorithmic discrimination and privacy issues, companies could still face FTC investigations today under a range of statutes that have been on the books for years, Khan and her fellow commissioners said.

“Throughout the FTC’s history we have had to adapt our enforcement to changing technology,” said FTC Commissioners Rebecca Slaughter. “Our obligation is to do what we’ve always done, which is to apply the tools we have to these changing technologies … [and] not be scared off by this idea that this is a new, revolutionary technology.”

FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya said companies cannot escape liability simply by claiming that their algorithms are a black box.

“Our staff has been consistently saying our unfair and deceptive practices authority applies, our civil rights laws, fair credit, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, those apply,” said Bedoya. “There is law, and companies will need to abide by it.”

The FTC has previously issued extensive public guidance to AI companies, and the agency last month received a request to investigate OpenAI over claims that the company behind ChatGPT has misled consumers about the tool’s capabilities and limitations.",2023-04-18 17:59:38,Politics

Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.

CNN —

Gobbling up too many refined wheat and rice products, along with eating too few whole grains, is fueling the growth of new cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide, according to a new study that models data through 2018.

“Our study suggests poor carbohydrate quality is a leading driver of diet-attributable type 2 diabetes globally,” says senior author Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a professor of nutrition at Tufts University and professor of medicine at Tufts School of Medicine in Boston, in a statement.

Another key factor: People are eating far too much red and processed meats, such as bacon, sausage, salami and the like, the study said. Those three factors — eating too few whole grains and too many processed grains and meats — were the primary drivers of over 14 million new cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine.

In fact, the study estimated 7 out of 10 cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide in 2018 were linked to poor food choices.

“These new findings reveal critical areas for national and global focus to improve nutrition and reduce devastating burdens of diabetes,” said Mozaffarian, who is also the editor in chief of the Tufts Health & Nutrition Letter.

Too many processed foods

Mozaffarian and his team developed a research model of dietary intake between 1990 and 2018 and applied it to 184 countries. Compared with 1990, there were 8.6 million more cases of type 2 diabetes due to poor diet in 2018, the study found.

Researchers found eating too many unhealthy foods was more of a driver of type 2 diabetes on a global level than a lack of eating wholesome foods, especially for men compared with women, younger compared to older adults, and in urban versus rural residents.

Over 60% of the total global diet-attributable cases of the disease were due to excess intake of just six harmful dietary habits: eating too much refined rice, wheat and potatoes; too many processed and unprocessed red meats; and drinking too many sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice.

Inadequate intake of five protective dietary factors — fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and yogurt — was responsible for just over 39% of the new cases.

People in Poland and Russia, where diets tend to focus on potatoes and red and processed meat, and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe as well as Central Asia, had the highest percentage of new type 2 diabetes cases linked to diet.

Colombia, Mexico and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean also had high numbers of new cases, which researchers said could be due to a reliance on sugary drinks and processed meat, as well as a low intake of whole grains.

“Our modeling approach does not prove causation, and our findings should be considered as estimates of risk,” the authors wrote.",2023-04-17 16:02:46,Business
16,ADHD medication abuse in schools is a 'wake-up call',https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/health/teen-misuse-adhd-meds-wellness/index.html,"CNN —

At some middle and high schools in the United States, 1 in 4 teens report they’ve abused prescription stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during the year prior, a new study found.

“This is the first national study to look at the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants by students in middle and high school, and we found a tremendous, wide range of misuse,” said lead author Sean Esteban McCabe, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

“In some schools there was little to no misuse of stimulants, while in other schools more than 25% of students had used stimulants in nonmedical ways,” said McCabe, who is also a professor of nursing at the University of Michigan School of Nursing. “This study is a major wake-up call.”

Nonmedical uses of stimulants can include taking more than a normal dose to get high, or taking the medication with alcohol or other drugs to boost a high, prior studies have found.

Students also overuse medications or “use a pill that someone gave them due to a sense of stress around academics — they are trying to stay up late and study or finish papers,” said pediatrician Dr. Deepa Camenga, associate director of pediatric programs at the Yale Program in Addiction Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.

“We know this is happening in colleges. A major takeaway of the new study is that misuse and sharing of stimulant prescription medications is happening in middle and high schools, not just college,” said Camenga, who was not involved with the study.

Wide range of abuse

Published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed data collected between 2005 and 2020 by Monitoring the Future, a federal survey that has measured drug and alcohol use among secondary school students nationwide each year since 1975.

In the data set used for this study, questionnaires were given to more than 230,000 teens in eighth, 10th and 12th grades in a nationally representative sample of 3,284 secondary schools.

Schools with the highest rates of teens using prescribed ADHD medications were about 36% more likely to have students misusing prescription stimulants during the past year, the study found. Schools with few to no students currently using such treatments had much less of an issue, but it didn’t disappear, McCabe said.

“We know that the two biggest sources are leftover medications, perhaps from family members such as siblings, and asking peers, who may attend other schools,” he said.

Schools in the suburbs in all regions of the United States except the Northeast had higher rates of teen misuse of ADHD medications, as did schools where typically one or more parent had a college degree, according to the study.

Schools with more White students and those who had medium levels of student binge drinking were also more likely to see teen abuse of stimulants.

On an individual level, students who said they had used marijuana in the past 30 days were four times as likely to abuse ADHD medications than teens who did not use weed, according to the analysis.

In addition, adolescents who said they used ADHD medications currently or in the past were about 2.5% more likely to have misused the stimulants when compared with peers who had never used stimulants, the study found.

“But these findings were not being driven solely by teens with ADHD misusing their medications,” McCabe said. “We still found a significant association, even when we excluded students who were never prescribed ADHD therapy.”

Data collection for the study was through 2020. Since then, new statistics show prescriptions for stimulants surged 10% during 2021 across most age groups. At the same time, there has been a nationwide shortage of Adderall, one of the most popular ADHD drugs, leaving many patients unable to fill or refill their prescriptions.

Dangers of misuse

The stakes are high: Taking stimulant medications improperly over time can result in stimulant use disorder, which can lead to anxiety, depression, psychosis and seizures, experts say.

If overused or combined with alcohol or other drugs, there can be sudden health consequences. Side effects can include “paranoia, dangerously high body temperatures, and an irregular heartbeat, especially if stimulants are taken in large doses or in ways other than swallowing a pill,” according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

Research has also shown people who misuse ADHD medications are highly likely to have multiple substance use disorders.

Abuse of stimulant drugs has grown over the past two decades, experts say, as more adolescents are diagnosed and prescribed those medications — studies have shown 1 in every 9 high school seniors report taking stimulant therapy for ADHD, McCabe said.

For children with ADHD who use their medications appropriately, stimulants can be effective treatment. They are “protective for the health of a child,” Camenga said. “Those adolescents diagnosed and treated correctly and monitored do very well — they have a lower risk of new mental health problems or new substance use disorders.”

What parents and caregivers can do

The solution to the problem of stimulant misuse among middle and high school teens isn’t to limit use of the medications for the children who really need them, McCabe stressed.

Parents should use a lockbox, count pills and stay on top of early prescription refills, experts say. Tassii/E+/Getty Images

“Instead, we need to look very long and hard at school strategies that are more or less effective in curbing stimulant medication misuse,” he said. “Parents can make sure the schools their kids attend have safe storage for medication and strict dispensing policies. And ask about prevalence of misuse — that data is available for every school.”

Families can also help by talking to their children about how to handle peers who approach them wanting a pill or two to party or pull an all-night study session, he added.

“You’d be surprised how many kids do not know what to say,” McCabe said. “Parents can role-play with their kids to give them options on what to say so they are ready when it happens.”

Parents and guardians should always store controlled medications in a lockbox, and should not be afraid to count pills and stay on top of early refills, he added.

“Finally, if parents suspect any type of misuse, they should contact their child’s prescriber right away,” McCabe said. “That child should be screened and assessed immediately.”",2023-04-25 17:44:36,Business

18,Democrats bash Justice Clarence Thomas but their plan to investigate ethics allegations is unclear,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/politics/clarence-thomas-ethics-democrats/index.html,"CNN —

Senate Democrats railed against Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday amid reports that the Supreme Court conservative failed to disclose luxury travel, gifts and a real estate transaction involving a GOP megadonor, but their plan to investigate the conservative jurist remains unclear.

Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin has promised that his committee will hold a hearing on the alleged ethics violations in the coming weeks, but shared no details when pressed by CNN on whether lawmakers will seek testimony from Thomas or others who might have knowledge about his relationship with the donor, Texas-based billionaire Harlan Crow.

Asked if subpoenas were on the table, Durbin said that no decision has been made on that yet. He said that it was “too soon” to share more information about what his committee’s hearing on Supreme Court ethics might look like. He and other Judiciary Democrats sent a letter to Chief Justice John Roberts last week calling for him to open an investigation into the Thomas allegations.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Tuesday that “the American people deserve all of the facts surrounding Justice Thomas’s blatant violation of law.”

“I hope that [Thomas] will voluntarily appear, and if not, we should consider subpoenas for him and others, like Harlan Crow, who have information,” Blumenthal said.

Other Democrats on the committee said Tuesday that they were deferring to Durbin, who huddled with Democrats on Monday evening to discuss their strategy towards Thomas.

Meanwhile, Republicans appear mostly united in defending the Thomas, suggesting the court can handle its own affairs.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attacked Democrats for criticizing the court, and said he has confidence in Roberts “to deal with these court internal issues.”

“The Democrats, it seems to me, spent a lot of time criticizing individual members of the court and going after the court as an institution,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday.

Bringing more transparency to the high court has had some bipartisan support in the past, but the court’s jerk to the right – particularly with the three justices that former President Donald Trump put on the bench – has raised the partisan stakes around the issue. In recent years, the conservative majority has handled pivotal rulings undoing abortions rights, dismantling gun regulations and reining in the powers of executive branch agencies – all prompting outcry from Democrats.

Even as Senate Democrats have yet to settle on a plan for their own response to the Thomas allegations, they sought to highlight the issue and framed it within their broader push for a code-of-ethics for the Supreme Court, which is excluded from many of the ethics rules that apply to lower rungs of the federal judiciary.

“I’m disturbed by the recent reports detailing potentially unethical – even potentially illegal conduct – at the highest levels of our judiciary,” Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat, said at a Judiciary Committee hearing for three lower court nominees on Tuesday. “It should go without saying that judges at all levels should be held to strict and enforceable ethical standards.”

Durbin said in a speech that Congress shouldn’t have to wait for the court to act.

“The Supreme Court doesn’t need to wait on Congress to clean up its act; the justices could take action today if they wanted to, and if the court fails to act, Congress must,” Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said on the Senate floor Tuesday.

Back-to back-reports in ProPublica this month detailed how luxury travel and gifts to Thomas from Crow – and even a real estate transaction – went unreported in Thomas’ annual financial disclosures.

Thomas has said that the travel and gifts to him and his family that were financed by the Crows went unreported because he had been advised that he was not required to do so, under an exemption in the court’s disclosure rules for so-called “personal hospitality.” After scrutiny of those rules by lawmakers, the Judicial Conference – which operates as the policy-making body for the federal judiciary – recently closed a loophole in those rules that appears to have covered some of the hospitality Thomas received. Thomas said that he intended to follow that updated guidance in the future, and a source close to the justice also told CNN in recent days that he planned to amend his disclosure form to report the real estate transaction, the sale of his mother’s home to Crow.

“If the reports are accurate, it stinks,” Sen. Mitt Romney said Monday evening, in rare comments from a Republican criticizing Thomas’ lack of transparency.

Republicans defend Thomas and say SCOTUS can address ethics internally

Other Republicans lined up in defense of the justice – who was named to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Bush in 1991 – and said it wasn’t Congress’ place to push an ethics code on the high court.

Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, suggested that the accusations against Thomas were part of a “multi-decade effort now to target Clarence Thomas by these liberal activist groups.”

This is not the first time Thomas has been at the center of an ethics controversy. Last year, CNN reported that his wife Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist, was texting with Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about the former president’s efforts overturn his 2020 election defeat, and her political lobbying has long raised questions about when justices are obligated to recuse themselves from cases.

Yet Republicans have shown little interest in joining Democrats in using legislation to impose an ethics code on the justices.

“The Court, kind of historically I think, has sort of policed itself,” said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the GOP’s Senate Whip, who said Thomas had been a “solid justice on the court through the years and has acquitted himself well there.”

“Let’s see what the court does,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, told CNN Tuesday. “I prefer them to do it internally.”",2023-04-18 20:29:46,Politics
19,Two Russians claiming to be former Wagner commanders admit killing children and civilians in Ukraine,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/europe/wagner-commanders-russia-kill-children-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN —

Two Russian men who claim to be former Wagner Group commanders have told a human rights activist that they killed children and civilians during their time in Ukraine.

The claims were made in video interviews with Gulagu.net, a human rights organization targeting corruption and torture in Russia.

In the video interviews posted online, former Russian convicts Azamat Uldarov and Alexey Savichev – who were both pardoned by Russian presidential decrees last year, according to Gulagu.net – described their actions in Ukraine, during Russia’s invasion.

CNN cannot independently verify their claims or identities in the videos but has obtained Russian penal documents showing they were released on presidential pardon in September and August of 2022.

Uldarov, who appears to have been drinking, details how he shot and killed a five- or six-year-old girl.

“(It was) a management decision. I wasn’t allowed to let anyone out alive, because my command was to kill anything in my way,” he said.

According to Gulagu.net, the testimonies were given to founder and Russian dissident Vladimir Osechkin over the span of a week. It said Uldarov and Savichev were in Russia when they spoke.

“I want Russia and other nations to know the truth. I don’t want war and bloodshed. You see I’m holding a cigarette in this hand. I followed orders with this hand and killed children,” Uldarov said, describing his motivation for the interview.

The Wagner Group is a Russian private mercenary organization fighting in Ukraine, headed by Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin.

It has recruited tens of thousands of fighters from Russian jails, offering freedom and cash after a six-month tour. It’s estimated by Western intelligence officials and prison advocacy groups that between 40,000 and 50,000 men were recruited.

Uldarov said in the eastern Ukrainian cities of Soledar and Bakhmut – which have seen some of the fiercest fighting – Wagner mercenaries “were given the command to annihilate everyone.”

“There is a superior over all the commanders – it’s Prigozhin, who told us not to let anyone get out of there and annihilate everyone,” he added. CNN has previously reported on former Wagner fighters making similar claims.

Uldarov has since appeared to recant his account in a video call with Prigozhin-linked Russian news agency RIA-FAN.

At one point in the interview, Savichev described how they “got the order to execute any men who were 15 years or older.”

He also talked about getting orders to ‘sweep’ a house. “It doesn’t matter whether there is a civilian there or not. The house needs to be swept. I didn’t give a f**k who was inside,” he said.

“Whether a hut or a house, the point was to make sure that there wasn’t a single living person left inside,” he said. “You can condemn me for this. I will not object. It’s your right. But I wanted to live, too.”

Savichev said Wagner fighters who did not follow orders were killed.

Wagner Group chief Prigozhin confirmed on his Telegram channel that he had watched parts of the video, and threatened retribution against the two former Wagner fighters. “As for what (Osechkin) filmed, I looked at the pieces of video I managed to see,” he said. “I can say the following: if at least one of these accusations against me is confirmed, I am ready to be held accountable according to any laws.”

But Prigozhin said that “if none is confirmed, I will send a list of 30-40 people who are spitting at me like Osechkin (there is a whole list of them, including the scum that fled Russia) that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine is obligated to hand over to me for a ‘fair trial,’ so to speak.”

“They will not be “civilians” for us, and especially not children, whom we have never touched and do not touch. This is a flagrant lie. These people (spreading the lies) are our enemies, and we will deal with them in a special way.”

Earlier, Prigozhin said on Telegram: “Regarding the execution of children, of course, no one ever shoots civilians or children, absolutely no one needs this. We came there to save them from the regime they were under.”

Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said in a tweet Monday that the group must be held accountable.

“Russian terrorists confessed to numerous murders of Ukrainian children in Bakhmut and Soledar. Confession is not enough. There must be a punishment. Tough and fair. And it will definitely be. How many more crimes like these have been committed?” he said.

In February, CNN spoke to two former Wagner fighters who described how recruited Wagner convicts are pushed to the front lines in a human wave, reminiscent of World War I charges. Deserters, or those who refuse orders are killed and there was no evacuation of the wounded, they said.

In January, US Treasury Department designated Wagner Group as a significant transnational criminal organization, and imposed a slew of fresh sanctions on a transnational network that supports it.

The US Department of State concurrently announced a number of sanctions meant to “target a range of Wagner’s key infrastructure – including an aviation firm used by Wagner, a Wagner propaganda organization, and Wagner front companies,” according to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.",2023-04-18 19:07:52,Politics

21,GOP prepared to block vote to replace Feinstein on Senate Judiciary,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/politics/schumer-senate-feinstein-vote-cardin/index.html,"CNN —

Republicans on Tuesday formally blocked a request from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to temporarily replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee, something Democrats hoped to do in order to advance stalled judicial nominations.

Senate Democrats are seeking to temporarily replace Feinstein on the powerful panel that processes judicial nominees as the California Democrat remains absent, recovering from shingles.

Senate Republicans, however, have made clear that they have been prepared to block Democratic efforts to replace Feinstein on the committee, ratcheting up pressure on the 89-year-old California Democrat to resign or return quickly.

Feinstein’s return date is still unclear and she asked just last week to be “temporarily” replaced on the committee as she recovers.

Schumer introduced his motion on Tuesday by talking about his friendship with Feinstein, and highlighting her accomplishments.

“Today, I am acting not just as Leader but as Dianne’s friend, in honoring her wishes, until she returns to the Senate,” Schumer said.

GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, objected to Schumer’s request, though he also praised the California Democrat. He argued that Schumer’s move is to get more judges confirmed.

“She’s a dear friend and we hope for her speedy recovery and return back to the Senate. With all due respect, my colleague, Senator Schumer, this is about a handful of judges that you can’t get the votes for,” Graham said.

Democrats could still force a vote to replace the Feinstein, but that would require the support of 10 Republicans and it’s unlikely they would use a lot of valuable floor time for something with little chance of success.

Feinstein, who has already announced she’s not seeking reelection, initially said she expected to return to Washington “by the end of the March work period,” but that her return got “delayed due to continued complications related to my diagnosis.”

She recently said she plans to return “as soon as possible once my medical team advises that it’s safe for me to travel.”

Cardin told CNN Tuesday he had discussed with Schumer being the temporary replacement on the committee but that he had not discussed the decision with Feinstein.

The Maryland Democrat said he and Feinstein have not spoken since she’s been out of the Senate and that it is his understanding that this is only a temporary move until she returns.

“I recognize the importance of the numbers on the committee, and this way we can be able to conduct business. I look at this as a way of dealing with a current situation,” Cardin said.

Democrats would need 60 votes to replace Feinstein on the panel, but senior Republicans in leadership and on the committee made clear Monday that they would not give them the votes to do that. If Feinstein does not return soon, at least 12 nominees, or possibly even more, could be stalled.

If Democrats are unable to replace Feinstein or if she does not return to Washington soon, they could see key agenda items thwarted – both on the committee and on the Senate floor.

Asked if the California Democrat should consider resigning if she can’t return by May, Schumer responded that he’s “hopeful” she will return “very soon.”

“Look, I spoke to Senator Feinstein just a few days ago and she and I are both very hopeful that she will return very soon,” Schumer said at his weekly policy press conference in the US Capitol.

Feinstein announced in February that she would not run for reelection, and a number of Democrats have already launched campaigns for her seat in 2024 in what is shaping up to be a competitive primary.

Many congressional Democrats have remained largely supportive of her decision to remain in office while absent from the Capitol as she recovers from shingles.

But Feinstein has faced calls to resign from two House Democrats – and if Democrats are not able to replace her on the committee, that number could start to grow.

Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin recently acknowledged to CNN that Feinstein’s absence had slowed down the party’s push to confirm nominees. But Durbin has stopped short of calling on Feinstein to resign, saying he hopes that Republicans will help to temporarily replace her on the committee and recognize that “the rain can fall on both sides of the road.”

Asked if her absence has longer ramifications for the Democrats’ ability to confirm nominees, the Illinois Democrat said, “Yes, of course it does,” pointing to the long process of getting nominees scheduled for votes during precious floor time.

Republican Sen. John Cornyn, a senior member on the Judiciary Committee and close adviser to McConnell, told CNN that he opposes the effort to replace Feinstein on the panel.

“I don’t think Republicans can or should help President Biden’s most controversial nominees,” the Texas Republican said. “I support having Sen. Feinstein come back as soon as she can. But this effort to confirm controversial and in many instances largely unqualified nominees, I don’t think you can expect any Republican cooperation.”

22,Oklahoma governor calls on officials to resign over recording of racist and threatening remarks,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/us/mccurtain-county-oklahoma-officials-recording/index.html,"CNN —

The governor of Oklahoma is calling on four McCurtain County officials to resign after they allegedly participated in a secretly recorded conversation that included racist remarks about lynching Black people and talking about killing journalists.

The McCurtain Gazette-News over the weekend published the audio it said was recorded following a Board of Commissioners meeting on March 6.

The paper said the audio of the meeting was legally obtained, but the McCurtain County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that it was illegally recorded and is investigating. The sheriff’s office also said it believes the recording had been altered.

“I am both appalled and disheartened to hear of the horrid comments made by officials in McCurtain County,” Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement Sunday. “There is simply no place for such hateful rhetoric in the state of Oklahoma, especially by those that serve to represent the community through their respective office. I will not stand idly by while this takes place,” the statement said.

The governor called for the immediate resignations of McCurtain County Sheriff Kevin Clardy, District 2 Commissioner Mark Jennings, sheriff’s investigator Alicia Manning and jail administrator Larry Hendrix. He also said he would ask the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation to look into the case.

McCurtain County is in southeastern Oklahoma, about 200 miles from Oklahoma City.

The recording was made hours after Gazette-News reporter Chris Willingham filed a lawsuit against the sheriff’s office, Manning and the Board of County Commissioners, alleging they had defamed him and violated his civil rights, the newspaper reported.

In the recording, Manning spoke of needing to go near the newspaper’s office and expressed concern about what would happen if she ran into Willingham, the Oklahoman reported, citing additional reporting from the Gazette-News.

According to the Oklahoman report, Jennings said, “Oh, you’re talking about you can’t control yourself?” and Manning replied: “Yeah, I ain’t worried about what he’s gonna do to me. I’m worried about what I might do to him. My papaw would have whipped his a**, would have wiped him and used him for toilet paper … if my daddy hadn’t been run over by a vehicle, he would have been down there.”

Jennings replied that his father was once upset by something the newspaper published and “started to go down there and just kill him,” according to the Gazette-News.

“I know where two big, deep holes are here if you ever need them,” Jennings allegedly said. Clardy, the sheriff, allegedly said he had the equipment.

“I’ve got an excavator,” Clardy is accused of saying during the discussion. “Well, these are already pre-dug,” Jennings allegedly said.

In other parts of the recording, officials expressed disappointment that Black people could no longer be lynched, according to the paper.

CNN has not been able to verify the authenticity of the recording or confirm who said what. CNN has reached out to all four county officials for comment.

The Oklahoma Sheriffs’ Association voted Tuesday to suspend the membership of Clardy, Manning and Hendrix, the group’s executive director told CNN.

State and local agencies investigating

Willingham and his father, Bruce Willingham, the paper’s publisher, have been advised to temporarily leave town, CNN affiliate KJRH reported.

“For nearly a year, they have suffered intimidation, ridicule and harassment based solely on their efforts to report the news for McCurtain County,” Kilpatrick Townsend, the law firm representing the Willingham family, told CNN in a statement.

The McCurtain County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement Monday that there is an “ongoing investigation into multiple significant violations” of the Oklahoma Security of Communications Act, which makes it “illegal to secretly record a conversation in which you are not involved and do not have the consent of at least one of the involved parties.” It also said the recording has yet to be “duly authenticated or validated.”

“Our preliminary information indicates that the media released audio recording has, in fact, been altered. The motivation for doing so remains unclear at this point. That matter is actively being investigated,” the statement said.

The Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office has received an audio recording and is investigating, Communications Director Phil Bacharach said.

The FBI wouldn’t confirm or deny whether it was involved in the investigation, with spokesperson Kayla McCleery saying it is agency policy not to comment.",2023-04-18 17:33:17,Politics

24,US warns Russia not to touch American nuclear technology at Ukrainian nuclear plant,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/politics/us-warns-russia-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant/index.html,"CNN —

The US has sensitive nuclear technology at a nuclear power plant inside Ukraine and is warning Russia not to touch it, according to a letter the US Department of Energy sent to Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy firm Rosatom last month.

In the letter, which was reviewed by CNN and is dated March 17, 2023, the director of the Energy Department’s Office of Nonproliferation Policy, Andrea Ferkile, tells Rosatom’s director general that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar “contains US-origin nuclear technical data that is export-controlled by the United States Government.”

Goods, software and technology are subject to US export controls when it is possible for them to be used in a way that undermines US national security interests.

The Energy Department letter comes as Russian forces continue to control the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe and sits in a part of the Zaporizhzhia region that Russia occupied after its invasion of Ukraine last February. The plant has frequently been disconnected from Ukraine’s power grid due to intense Russian shelling in the area, raising fears across Europe of a nuclear accident.

While the plant is still physically operated by Ukrainian staff, Rosatom manages it. The Energy Department warned Rosatom in the letter that it is “unlawful” for any Russian citizens or entities to handle the US technology.

CNN has reached out to Rosatom for comment.

Video Ad Feedback Satellite images show changes Russia are making to occupied nuclear plant 03:36 - Source: CNN

“It is unlawful under United States law for non-authorized persons, including, but not limited to, Russian citizens and Russian entities,” the letter says, “such as Rosatom and its subsidiaries, to knowingly and willfully access, possess, control, export, store, seize, review, re-export, ship, transfer, copy, manipulate such technology or technical data, or direct, or authorize others to do the same, without such Russian entities becoming authorized recipients by the Secretary of the US Department of Energy.”

It is not clear whether Rosatom has responded to the letter. The Energy Department’s National Nuclear Security Administration told CNN in a statement that the letter is authentic.

The letters were first reported by the news outlet RBC Ukraine.

“The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration can confirm that the letter is legitimate,” said Shayela Hassan, the deputy director of public affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration.

She added: “The Secretary of Energy has the statutory responsibility for authorizing the transfer of unclassified civilian nuclear technology and assistance to foreign atomic energy activities. DOE does not comment on regulatory activities.”

Another letter from Ferkile to the Energy Department’s Inspector General, reviewed by CNN and dated October 24, 2022, outlines the technology the US has exported to Ukraine for use in the Zaporizhzhia plant and reiterates that the department has “no record of any current authorization to transfer this technology and technical data to any Russian national or entity.”

The Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy has been public about the US’ support for the plant, and stated on its website in June 2021 that “the United States helped implement new maintenance procedures and operations at the reactor that should ultimately strengthen energy security” in Ukraine.

26,FDA clears the way for additional bivalent boosters for certain vulnerable individuals,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/health/fda-bivalent-booster-additional-doses/index.html,"CNN —

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration amended the terms of its emergency use authorizations for the Pfizer and Moderna bivalent vaccines on Tuesday, allowing people ages 65 and older and certain people with weakened immunity to get additional doses before this fall’s vaccination campaigns.

The bivalent vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna carry instructions for fighting both the original strain of the Covid-19 virus as well as Omicron and its spinoffs.

They have been available in the United States since September under emergency use authorizations, or EUAs, which tightly restrict how the vaccines may be given.

On Tuesday, the FDA changed the terms of the authorizations for those vaccines so that certain individuals could get an additional dose ahead of most others.

Namely, adults ages 65 and older who have received a single dose of a bivalent vaccine may receive an additional dose at least four months following their first dose.

Most individuals with certain degrees of immunocompromise who have received a first dose of a bivalent vaccine can get a second at least 2 months later. Additional doses may be administered at the discretion of their healthcare provider.

Dr. Peter Hotez, who co-directs the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, has been calling on the FDA to increase access to the bivalent boosters for those who want them. He says for the most part, today’s guidance from the agency makes sense.

“My only question is why the 65 year age cutoff? What was that based on? Ordinarily I would have preferred that it be brought down to 60 or even 50,” Hotez said in an email to CNN.

“For those Americans who understand its importance, we should make second bivalent boosters available. Finally, we’ll soon need guidance about another annual fall booster. Presumably that information comes sometime this summer,” he added.

For immunocompromised children ages 6 months through 4 years, eligibility for additional bivalent doses will depend on the vaccine previously received, the FDA said in a news release.

Another big change is that most unvaccinated individuals may now receive a single dose of a bivalent vaccine, rather than mutiple doses of the original single-strain vaccines, the agency said. The FDA simplified its recommendation for unvaccinated individuals after recognizing that most Americans now have some immunity against Covid-19, even if its just through past infections.

“Evidence is now available that most of the U.S. population 5 years of age and older has antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, either from vaccination or infection that can serve as a foundation for the protection provided by the bivalent vaccines. COVID-19 continues to be a very real risk for many people, and we encourage individuals to consider staying current with vaccination, including with a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. The available data continue to demonstrate that vaccines prevent the most serious outcomes of COVID-19, which are severe illness, hospitalization, and death,” said Dr. Peter Marks, head of FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a news release.

Children ages 6 months through 5 years who have not yet been vaccinated may now receive a two-dose series of the Moderna bivalent vaccine as their primary series, or a three-dose series of the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine if they are 6 months through 4 years of age. Children who are age 5 may receive two doses of the Moderna bivalent or a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine.

Children ages 6 months through 5 years who got started on their monovalent vaccines, can now get a dose of a bivalent vaccine, but the number of doses they qualify for will depend on the number of doses they’ve already had and what kind of vaccine they got.

The agency stressed that most people who have gotten one dose of a bivalent vaccine are not currently eligible for a second dose.

And they encouraged everyone who hasn’t yet gotten their first dose of a bivalent vaccine to do so, and many Americans are still in that bucket.

Only about 17% of those eligible, less than 1 in 5 Americans, has gotten a recommended dose.

As time has passed, adults with reduced immune function because of their age or an underlying health problem have been asking doctors whether they need another dose of the bivalent vaccines.

The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported early data showing that the effectiveness of the bivalent vaccines, even against emergency room visits and hospitalizations, has already started to wane.

But the agency has not been free to make what’s known as a “permissive use” recommendation about the boosters, which would allow doctors to offer additional doses to vulnerable patients because of the terms of the EUA.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team.

The updated terms give the CDC and its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) greater freedom to recommend additional doses of the bivalent vaccines. The ACIP is holding a meeting on the Covid-19 vaccines Wednesday and is expected to endorse the FDA’s changes.

For everyone not covered by today’s changes, the FDA says it intends to make decisions about future vaccinations after receiving recommendations on the fall strain composition from its advisory committee in June.

Both Canada and the United Kingdom have offered another round of bivalent boosters to those at highest risk from Covid-19 this spring.",2023-04-18 15:09:15,Business
27,Maine authorities detained a person of interest after 4 people were found dead in a home and 3 others shot while driving,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/us/maine-shooting-bowdoin-yarmouth/index.html,"CNN —

A 34-year-old man was arrested Tuesday evening in connection with the killings of four people who were found dead earlier in the day at a Bowdoin, Maine, home, authorities said.

The killings appeared to be connected to a series of nearby highway shootings that left three drivers injured – including one critically – shortly after the four bodies were discovered, state police have said.

The man arrested was identified by Maine State Police as Joseph Eaton.

Eaton was taken to Two Bridges Regional Jail and will make an initial court appearance later in the week, state police said in a Tuesday evening news release. Officials said Wednesday that for the moment Eaton is only accused of the killings.

CNN has not yet been able to identify an attorney for Eaton.

“Investigators will be working throughout the night processing multiple scenes and continuing to interview people involved with this incident,” state police said in the news release.

Police have not shared details about a possible motive in the two incidents and did not share details about the four people found dead in the home.

In a statement on Twitter, Maine Gov. Janet Mills said, “Like people across Maine, I am shocked and deeply saddened – acts of violence like we experienced today shake our state and our communities to the core.”

Vehicles ‘hit by straight gunfire’

Maine State Police responded Tuesday morning to the Bowdoin home, where they found the four deceased victims inside, state police Lt. Randall Keaten said in a news conference earlier Tuesday.

Shortly after, authorities received reports of several vehicles getting hit by gunfire on I-295 in the area of Yarmouth, which is about 40 minutes from Bowdoin.

Three people were shot while driving and were taken to the hospital, state police said. At least one of those three was in critical condition Tuesday, authorities added.

“We’ve got vehicles that have been hit by straight gunfire all across that we’re getting reports on, so if anybody has holes in their vehicles, please contact us so that we can follow up with that,” Keaten said.

The victims found in the Bowdoin home and the highway shootings are connected, Keaten said, adding there is no threat to the public.

The four bodies were taken to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Augusta where autopsies will determine the manner and cause of death state police said.

Authorities have asked anyone who may have witnessed something or has any information about the Tuesday morning incidents to reach out.

“A lot happened this morning between those two scenes and those are the people that we want to talk to, those people that were impacted by this,” Keaten said, adding authorities were continuing to work on several impacted scenes and gather more information.",2023-04-19 01:49:51,Politics
28,Southwest says flights resumed after delays caused by 'tech issues',https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/southwest-airlines-flight-delays/index.html,"CNN —

Hundreds of Southwest Airlines flights were delayed after technical issues that prompted the airline to temporarily halt its operations on Tuesday morning.

Southwest said the flight delays were the result of “data connection issues resulting from a firewall failure,” a problem that led to a brief ground stop.

The Federal Aviation Administration initiated the ground stop at the airline’s request, citing “equipment issues.” The ground stop was soon lifted, and in a tweet at 11:35 a.m. ET Southwest said it had resumed operations.

“Early this morning, a vendor-supplied firewall went down and connection to some operational data was unexpectedly lost,” spokesman Dan Landson said in a statement.

Southwest had delayed 1,820 flights or 43% of its schedule as of just after noon Tuesday, according to FlightAware. The airline has canceled only nine flights on Tuesday, according to FlightAware. Southwest says its workers “worked quickly to minimize disruptions.”

Southwest reported technology issues Tuesday morning and said it would “hopefully be resuming our operation as soon as possible.”

The FAA in a statement told CNN that Southwest “requested the FAA pause the airline’s departures.”

The problems come months after the airline was forced to cancel more than 16,700 flights between December 20 and 29, roughly half its schedule during that period. The airline attributed the meltdown in part to changes to its staff scheduling computer systems. Southwest last month unveiled an “action plan” to prevent another operational meltdown.

Southwest called the latest problem “intermittent technology issues” in a social media post to customers. Several took to social media to complain about delayed flights.

“We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we’re hoping to get everyone going ASAP,” the airline wrote in another social media post.

A massive winter storm started the service problems during the holiday season, but Southwest had a much tougher time recovering because of an antiquated crew scheduling system that was quickly overwhelmed, leaving the airline unable to get the staffing it needed to locations to operate flights.

29,Damar Hamlin cleared to resume football activities after January cardiac arrest,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/sport/damar-hamlin-cleared-to-train-nfl-spt-intl/index.html,"CNN —

Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin, who has been cleared to resume football activities, said Tuesday his cardiac arrest during an NFL game in January was caused by commotio cordis.

Hamlin went into cardiac arrest after making a tackle and appearing to be hit with a helmet in his chest during the first quarter of the Bills’ game against the Cincinnati Bengals on January 2.

Commotio cordis can occur when severe trauma to the chest disrupts the heart’s electrical charge and causes dangerous fibrillations.

“I died on national TV in front of the whole world,” Hamlin said in his first session with reporters since the injury. “I lost a bunch of people in my life. I know a bunch of people who lost people in their lives. I know that feeling. That right there is the biggest blessing of it all – for me to still have my people and my people to still have me.”

The 25-year-old has been at the Bills’ practice facility in Orchard Park, New York, participating in voluntary offseason workouts this week, according to the team.

“He is fully cleared,” Bills General Manager Brandon Beane told reporters. “He’s here.”

Hamlin said he was blessed to have a wonderful medical staff who “treat me with the care of their children.”

The safety said his heart is still in the game and he was announcing his comeback to the NFL.

“I just want to show people that fear is a choice. You can keep going at something without having the answers and without knowing what’s at the end of the tunnel,” he said. “You might feel anxious – you might feel any type of way – but you just keep putting that right foot in front of the left one and you keep going. I want to stand for that.”

Beane said that Hamlin had seen three separate specialists over the offseason, who all agreed that the player “is clear to resume full activities just like anyone else who was coming back from an injury.”

“(Hamlin’s) in a great headspace to come back and make his return,” Beane added.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said the team is happy that Hamlin is back.

“We’re super excited for Damar. He’s moving forward one step at a time here. He’s been cleared from a physical standpoint,” McDermott said.

“We’ll provide all of the mental help we can from a mind, body and spirit standpoint so just happy for him that he’s been able to check some of those boxes to this point and we’re moving forward taking it one day at a time.”

According to the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, if no underlying cardiac abnormalities are discovered through testing, athletes who have been resuscitated from commotio cordis may return to playing.

Hamlin likely went through a lot of tests, including electrocardiograms and echocardiograms, before doctors cleared him to return to training.

“What it basically means a few things. One is that his heart function returned to normal. He has no underlying problems with the anatomy of the heart itself, and he has no underlying electrical problems, so that’s the most important thing – and the way they figured that out over the last three-and-a-half months was to do a lot of tests,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said on “CNN News Central.”",2023-04-18 22:11:37,Politics

31,Top US Navy admiral defends non-binary sailor amid some Republican criticism,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/politics/gilday-defends-non-binary-sailor/index.html,"CNN —

The top US Navy admiral ardently defended a non-binary sailor on Tuesday amid some criticism from Republican lawmakers, saying he is “particularly proud of this sailor.”

The sailor, LTJG Audrey Knutson, had their story shared on the Navy’s Instagram page last week. In a short video, Knutson said they are proud to serve as non-binary, especially because their grandfather served in the Navy as a gay man in World War II. During a deployment last fall aboard the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, Knutson said their highlight was reading a poem to the whole ship at an LGBTQ spoken word night. The Instagram video garnered nearly 17,000 likes.

Subsequently, Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, tweeted a portion of the clip with the caption, “While China prepares for war, this is what they have our US Navy focused on.” On Tuesday, Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama, continued attacking the video, telling the Senate Armed Services Committee he had “a lot of problems with the video.”

But Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday defended the sailor, emphasizing that it’s the job of a commanding officer to build a warfighting team.

“I’ll tell you why I’m particularly proud of this sailor,” Gilday told the hearing. “So, her grandfather served during World War II, and he was gay and he was ostracized in the very institution that she not only joined and is proud to be a part of, but she volunteered to deploy on Ford and she’ll likely deploy again next month when Ford goes back to sea.”

Gilday used female pronouns to refer to Knutson but the Navy told CNN Knutson’s pronouns of choice are non-binary.

“We ask people from all over the country, from all walks of life, from all different backgrounds to join us,” Gilday said, “and then it’s the job of a commanding officer to build a cohesive warfighting team that’s going to follow the law, and the law requires that we be able to conduct prompt, sustained operations at sea. That level of trust that a commanding officer develops across that unit has to be able to be grounded on dignity and respect, and so … if that officer can lawfully join the United States Navy, is willing to serve and willing to take the same oath that you and I took to put their life on the line, then I’m proud to serve beside them.”

Some Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill have attacked the military for being too “woke,” claiming it has been one of the causes of the military’s poor recruiting numbers, despite a recent Army survey showing only 5% of potential recruits were concerned about “wokeness.”

Last month, Republican Rep. Cory Mills and several others went after the Defense Department on its diversity, equity and inclusion training at a House Armed Services Subcommittee hearing on military personnel. Mills said, “We absolutely 150% can out-pronoun every single one of our adversaries, and China and Russia I’m sure are quaking in their boots over this.”

In response, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Gil Cisneros said diversity and equal opportunity training have been a part of the military for decades.

At another hearing in early-March with the military’s top enlisted leaders, Sgt. Maj. Of the Army Michael Grinston stressed that the military’s focus remains on combat lethality, even with additional training on diversity and inclusion.

“There is one hour of equal opportunity training in basic training, and 92 hours of rifle marksmanship training,” Grinston said at the time. “And if you go to [One Station Unit Training], there is 165 hours of rifle marksmanship training and still only one hour of equal opportunity training.”",2023-04-18 19:56:40,Politics
32,Fulton County DA says fake Trump electors are incriminating one another and wants lawyer disqualified,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/politics/fulton-county-trump-fake-electors/index.html,"CNN —

The Fulton County District Attorney’s office said some fake electors for Donald Trump have implicated each other in potential criminal activity and is seeking to disqualify their lawyer, according to a new court filing.

The district attorney’s office is requesting that attorney Kimberly Bourroughs Debrow be disqualified from representing a group of 10 Republicans who served as electors for the former president in Georgia – a state Trump lost to President Joe Biden. The DA’s office also accused the lawyer of failing to present an immunity deal to her clients last year, according to the filing.

The new filing offers the latest indication that immunity offers could still be in the works months after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis suggested charging decisions were “imminent.”

It notes that investigators interviewed some of the fake GOP electors this month and there is jockeying behind the scenes ahead of the announcement on who, if anyone, will face charges in the long-running probe into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia.

“The statement of some of her clients that directly implicate another client in additional crimes shows that Ms. Debrow’s continued participation in this matter is fraught with conflicts of interest that rise to the level of her being disqualified from this case in its entirety,” the district attorney’s office wrote in the filing.

During the April 2023 interviews, “some of the electors stated that another elector represented by Ms. Debrow committed acts that are violations of Georgia law and that they were not party to these additional acts,” according to the filing.

Amid a fight last year to compel the fake electors to testify, the court instructed two attorneys, including Debrow, to inform their clients with potential immunity deals. The attorneys told the court that they spoke to their clients and none of the clients were interested, according to filing. Now the DA’s office is claiming those offers were never presented to the clients.

“Additionally, in these interviews, some of the electors represented by Ms. Debrow told members of the investigation team that no potential offer of immunity was ever brought to them in 2022,” the filing states.

Debrow slammed the latest motion in a statement.

“The DA’s Motion is baseless, false, and offensive,” Debrow said. “None of my clients have committed any crimes, and they necessarily have not implicated themselves or each other in any crimes.”

No one has been charged yet in the Georgia case, though several people – including the 16 fake electors and former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani – were informed they were potential targets of Willis’s probe.

A special grand jury investigating the matter concluded its work late last year and recommended more than a dozen people should face charges, the foreperson for the panel said in interviews.

33,High speed trains are racing across the world. But not in America,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/high-speed-rail-us/index.html,"CNN —

High speed trains have proved their worth across the world over the past 50 years.

It’s not just in reducing journey times, but more importantly, it’s in driving economic growth, creating jobs and bringing communities closer together. China, Japan and Europe lead the way.

So why doesn’t the United States have a high-speed rail network like those?

For the richest and most economically successful nation on the planet, with an increasingly urbanized population of more than 300 million, it’s a position that is becoming more difficult to justify.

Although Japan started the trend with its Shinkansen “Bullet Trains” in 1964, it was the advent of France’s TGV in the early 1980s that really kick-started a global high-speed train revolution that continues to gather pace.

But it’s a revolution that has so far bypassed the United States. Americans are still almost entirely reliant on congested highways or the headache-inducing stress of an airport and airline network prone to meltdowns.

China has built around 26,000 miles (42,000 kilometers) of dedicated high-speed railways since 2008 and plans to top 43,000 miles (70,000 kilometers) by 2035.

Meanwhile, the United States has just 375 route-miles of track cleared for operation at more than 100 mph.

Many Americans have no concept of high-speed rail and fail to see its value. They are hopelessly stuck with a highway and airline mindset. William C. Vantuono, editor-in-chief of Railway Age

“Many Americans have no concept of high-speed rail and fail to see its value. They are hopelessly stuck with a highway and airline mindset,” says William C. Vantuono, editor-in-chief of Railway Age, North America’s oldest railroad industry publication.

Cars and airliners have dominated long-distance travel in the United States since the 1950s, rapidly usurping a network of luxurious passenger trains with evocative names such as “The Empire Builder,” “Super Chief” and “Silver Comet.”

Deserted by Hollywood movie stars and business travelers, famous railroads such as the New York Central were largely bankrupt by the early 1970s, handing over their loss-making trains to Amtrak, the national passenger train operator founded in 1971.

In the decades since that traumatic retrenchment, US freight railroads have largely flourished. Passenger rail seems to have been a very low priority for US lawmakers.

Powerful airline, oil and auto industry lobbies in Washington have spent millions maintaining that superiority, but their position is weakening in the face of environmental concerns and worsening congestion.

Billions for rail improvements

US President Joe Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill includes an unprecedented $170 billion for improving railroads.

Some of this will be invested in repairing Amtrak’s crumbling Northeast Corridor (NEC) linking Boston, New York and Washington.

There are also big plans to bring passenger trains back to many more cities across the nation – providing fast, sustainable travel to cities and regions that have not seen a passenger train for decades.

Add to this the success of the privately funded Brightline operation in Florida, which has been given the green light to build a $10 billion high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and Las Vegas by 2027, plus schemes in California, Texas and the proposed Cascadia route linking Portland, Oregon, with Seattle and Vancouver, and the United States at last appears to be on the cusp of a passenger rail revolution.

Bigger investment

“Every president since Ronald Reagan has talked about the pressing need to improve infrastructure across the USA, but they’ve always had other, bigger priorities to deal with,” says Scott Sherin, chief commercial officer of train builder Alstom’s US division.

“But now there’s a huge impetus to get things moving – it’s a time of optimism. If we build it, they will come. As an industry, we’re maturing, and we’re ready to take the next step. It’s time to focus on passenger rail.”

Sherin points out that other public services such as highways and airports are “massively subsidized,” so there shouldn’t be an issue with doing the same for rail.

High-speed rail is not the solution for everything, but it has its place. Scott Sherin, CCO of Alstom's US division

“We need to do a better job of articulating the benefits of high-speed rail – high-quality jobs, economic stimulus, better connectivity than airlines – and that will help us to build bipartisan support,” he adds. “High-speed rail is not the solution for everything, but it has its place.”

Only Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor has trains that can travel at speeds approaching those of the 300 kilometers per hour (186 mph) TGV and Shinkansen.

Even here, Amtrak Acela trains currently max out at 150 mph – and only in short bursts. Maximum speeds elsewhere are closer to 100 mph on congested tracks shared with commuter and freight trains.

New generation of trains

This year, Amtrak plans to introduce its new generation Avelia Liberty trains to replace the life-expired Acelas on the NEC.

Capable of reaching 220 mph (although they’ll be limited to 160 mph on the NEC), the trains will bring Alstom’s latest high-speed rail technology to North America.

The locomotives at each end – known as power cars – are close relatives of the next generation TGV-M trains, scheduled to debut in France in 2024.

Sitting between the power cars are the passenger vehicles, which use Alstom’s Tiltronix technology to run faster through curves by tilting their bodies, much like a MotoGP rider does. And it’s not just travelers who will benefit.

“When Amtrak awarded the contract to Alstom in 2015 to 2016, the company had around 200 employees in Hornell,” says Shawn D. Hogan, former mayor of the city of Hornell in New York state.

“That figure is now nearer 900, with hiring continuing at a fast pace. I calculate that there has been a total public/private investment of more than $269 million in our city since 2016, including a new hotel, a state-of-the-art hospital and housing developments.

“It is a transformative economic development project that is basically unheard of in rural America and if it can happen here, it can happen throughout the United States.”

Alstom has spent almost $600 million on building a US supply chain for its high-speed trains – more than 80% of the train is made in the United States, with 170 suppliers across 27 states.

“High-speed rail is already here. Avelia Liberty was designed jointly with our European colleagues, so we have what we need for ‘TGV-USA’,” adds Sherin.

“It’s all proven tech from existing trains. We’re ready to go when the infrastructure arrives.”

And those new lines could arrive sooner than you might think.

Incoming high-speed lines

In March, Brightline confirmed plans to begin construction on a 218-mile (351-kilometer) high-speed line between Rancho Cucamonga, near Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, carving a path through the San Bernardino Mountains and across the desert, following the Interstate 15 corridor.

The 200 mph line will slash times to little more than one hour – a massive advantage over the four-hour average by car or five to seven hours by bus – when it opens in 2027.

Mike Reininger, CEO of Brightline Holdings, says: “As the most shovel-ready high-speed rail project in the United States, we are one step closer to leveling the playing field against transit and infrastructure projects around the world, and we are proud to be using America’s most skilled workers to get there.”

Brightline West expects to inject around $10 billion worth of benefits into the region’s economy, creating about 35,000 construction jobs, as well as 1,000 permanent jobs in maintenance, operations and customer service in Southern California and Nevada.

It will also mark the return of passenger trains to Las Vegas after a 30-year hiatus – Amtrak canceled its “Desert Wind” route in 1997.

Brightline hopes to attract around 12 million of the 50 million one-way trips taken annually between Las Vegas and LA, 85% of which are taken by bus or car.

Another California project

Meanwhile, construction is progressing on another high-speed line through the San Joaquin Valley.

Set to open around 2030, California High Speed Rail (CHSR) will run from Merced to Bakersfield (171 miles) at speeds of up to 220 mph.

Coupled with proposed upgrades to commuter rail lines at either end, this project could eventually allow high-speed trains to run the 350 miles (560 kilometers) between Los Angeles to San Francisco metropolitan areas in just two hours and 40 minutes.

CHSR has been on the table as far back as 1996, but its implementation has been controversial.

Disagreements over the route, management issues, delays in land acquisition and construction, cost over-runs and inadequate funding for completing the entire system have plagued the project – despite the economic benefits it will deliver as well as reducing pollution and congestion. Around 10,000 people are already employed on the project.

Costing $63 billion to $98 billion, depending on the final extent of the scheme, CHSR is to connect six of the 10 largest cities in the state and provide the same capacity as 4,200 miles of new highway lanes, 91 additional airport gates and two new airport runways costing between $122 billion and $199 billion.

With California’s population expected to grow to more than 45 million by 2050, high-speed rail offers the best value solution to keep the state from grinding to a smoggy halt.

Corridors for the greatest potential

Brightline West and CHSR offer templates for the future expansion of high-speed rail in North America.

By focusing on pairs of cities or regions that are too close for air travel and too far apart for car drivers, transportation planners can predict which corridors offer the greatest potential.

“It’s logical that the US hasn’t yet developed a nationwide high-speed network,” says Sherin. “For decades, traveling by car wasn’t a hardship, but as highway congestion gets worse, we’ve reached a stage where we should start looking more seriously at the alternatives.

“The magic numbers are centers of population with around three million people that are 200 to 500 miles apart, giving a trip time of less than three hours – preferably two hours.

“Where those conditions apply in Europe and Asia, high-speed rail reduces air’s share of the market from 100% to near zero. The model would work just as well in the USA as it does globally.”

Pipe dream?

Sherin points to the success of the original generation of Acela trains as evidence of this.

“When the first generation Acela trains started running between New York City and Washington in 2000, Amtrak attracted so many travelers that the airlines stopped running their frequent ‘shuttles’ between the two cities,” he adds.

However, industry observer Vantuono is more pessimistic.

“A US high-speed rail network is a pipe dream,” he says. “A lack of political support and federal financial support combined with the kind of fierce landowner opposition that CHSR has faced in California means that the challenges for new high-speed projects are enormous.”

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), urban and high-speed rail hold “major promise to unlock substantial benefits” in reducing global transport emissions.

Despite the advent of cars and airplanes, rail of all types has continued to evolve and thrive. Fatih Birol, IEA executive director

Dr. Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, argues that rail transport is “often neglected” in public debates about future transport systems – and this is especially true in North America.

“Despite the advent of cars and airplanes, rail of all types has continued to evolve and thrive,” adds Birol.

Globally, around three-quarters of rail passenger movements are made on electric-powered vehicles, putting the mode in a unique position to take advantage of the rise in renewable energy over the coming decades.

Here, too, the United States lags far behind the rest of the world, with electrification almost unheard of away from the NEC.

Rail networks in South Korea, Japan, Europe, China and Russia are more than 60% electrified, according to IEA figures, the highest share of track electrification being South Korea at around 85%.

In North America, on the other hand, less than 5% of rail routes are electrified.

The enormous size of the United States and its widely dispersed population mitigates against the creation of a single, unified network of the type being built in China and proposed for Europe.

Air travel is likely to remain the preferred option for transcontinental journeys that can be more than 3,000 miles (around 4,828 kilometers).

But there are many shorter inter-city travel corridors where high-speed rail, or a combination of new infrastructure and upgraded railroad tracks or tilting trains, could eventually provide an unbeatable alternative to air travel and highways.",2023-04-19 02:39:40,Business
34,Here's what you need to know if you haven't filed your return yet — and even if you have,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/success/tax-day-2023-file-irs/index.html,"Editor’s Note: This is an updated version of a story that originally ran on April 14, 2023.

New York CNN —

It’s April 18, the official deadline to file your federal and state income tax returns for 2022. (It is also, apparently, National Animal Crackers Day for those who celebrate.)

Whether you have already filed your tax return or still need to, the good news is this tax filing season has gone much more smoothly than the past three, which were hurt by the pandemic.

“This is the first tax season since 2019 where the IRS and the nation were on normal footing,” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a call with reporters.

For instance, Werfel noted that since January, thanks to an infusion of some new funding after years of budget cuts, IRS employees have been able to answer 87% of calls from filers with questions. Last year, they answered fewer than 15%. And the wait times on those phone calls dropped to just 4 minutes this filing season from 27 minutes last filing season.

The agency also added a roster of new online tools for filers, he added.

Still haven’t filed?

Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.

Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.

Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson.

If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail.

Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return.

Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so.

Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include:

Interest on your savings

Investment income (e.g., dividends and capital gains)

Pay for part-time or seasonal work, or a side hustle

Unemployment income

Social Security benefits or distribution from a retirement account

Tips

Gambling winnings

Income from a rental property you own

Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.).

If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically.

Here are some of the tax forms you may have received:

W-2 from your wage or salaried jobs

from your wage or salaried jobs 1099-B for capital gains and losses on your investments

for capital gains and losses on your investments 1099-DIV from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments

from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments 1099-INT for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution

for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution 1099-NEC from your clients, if you worked as a contractor

from your clients, if you worked as a contractor 1099-K for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The 1099-K is required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didn’t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022.

for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The 1099-K is required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didn’t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022. 1099-Rs for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract

for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract SSA-1099 or SSA-1042S for Social Security benefits received.

“Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society.

One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings.

Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer.

Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank.

What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.

Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18.

So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday.

You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.

Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions.

If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option.

You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances.

If you can’t pay what you owe in full, the IRS does have some payment plan options. But it might be smart to first consult with a certified public accountant or a tax preparer who is an enrolled agent to make sure you are making the best choice for your circumstance.

If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.

Use this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an “interactive tax assistant” that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.

Already filed?

If you’ve already filed your return, you’re probably glad to have it in the rear view mirror. But you may still have a few questions about what’s ahead.

What about my refund? If you are due a refund, the IRS typically sends it within 21 days of receiving your return. When yours does arrive, it may be smaller than last year, even if your financial life didn’t change much. That’s because a number of Covid-related tax breaks expired.

So far, the average refund paid was $2,878 for the week ending April 7, down from $3,175 at the same point in last year’s filing season.

Will I be audited?: The reasons and methods for auditing a taxpayer can vary — and many audits result in “no change,” meaning you don’t end up owing anything more to the IRS. But one thing is common for the vast majority of US tax filers: Audit rates are exceedingly low.

For filers reporting incomes between $50,000 and $200,000, only 0.1% of them were audited in 2020, according to the latest data from the IRS. Even for very high income filers, audit rates were quite low: Just 0.4% for those reporting income of between $1 million and $5 million; 0.7% for those with income between $5 million and $10 million; and 2.4% for returns with income over $10 million.

Looking ahead, the IRS commissioner noted in a press call that the agency will be using money from the Inflation Reduction Act to bolster its compliance efforts to focus more on auditing high-income individuals — defined as making $400,000 or more. As for filers with income below that level, he said he did not anticipate any change in the likelihood they would be audited.",2023-04-18 14:15:43,Business
35,"Undocumented immigrants are paying their taxes today, too",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/us/undocumented-immigrants-taxes-cec/index.html,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story first published in 2019.

CNN —

It’s a surprising fact that’s often overlooked in the immigration debate.

Undocumented immigrants pay billions of dollars in federal taxes annually, between tax returns filed and taxes deducted from paychecks, experts estimate.

Here’s a look at why – and how – this is happening.

Why some undocumented immigrants choose to pay taxes

The National Immigration Law Center breaks down a number of reasons why undocumented immigrants pay taxes, including:

• It shows they’re complying with federal tax laws.

• It can help them demonstrate “good moral character” if they later have an opportunity to legalize their immigration status.

• Tax return records could be used to document work history and presence in the US, steps that may help them be eligible for legal immigration status in the future if lawmakers pass immigration reform.

How some pay taxes despite not having Social Security numbers

Critics of illegal immigration have long argued that undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are able to do so because they’re using stolen Social Security numbers. But millions of federal tax dollars are paid every year by people who don’t have Social Security numbers at all.

Instead, they file using what’s known as an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).

The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based think tank, notes that “most experts believe the vast majority of tax returns filed with ITINs today are filed by undocumented immigrants.”

Some noncitizens who legally immigrated to the United States also pay taxes using this method.

In 2019, according to the IRS, more than 2.5 million tax returns were filed using ITINs, accounting for nearly $6 billion in taxes.

In addition to tax return filings, officials estimate that undocumented immigrants also contribute billions to Social Security annually through payroll tax deductions. In 2010, for example, the Social Security Administration estimated that payments from unauthorized workers accounted for about $12 billion in tax revenue for Social Security.

Immigrant rights advocates are speaking out on social media

In recent years, immigrant rights advocates’ posts on Facebook, Twitter and TikTok during tax season have drawn attention to the issue.

“Undocumented immigrants pay billions in taxes to fund programs they can’t access,” the National immigration Law Center wrote in a series of recent social media posts.

In 2017, Belén Sisa’s post about her experience paying taxes went viral.

“Wanna tell me again how I should be deported, contribute nothing and only leech off this country while the 1% wealthiest people in this country steal from you everyday?” wrote Sisa, who was a college student in Arizona at the time.

The beneficiary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program later told CNN she felt it was important to speak out.

“I wanted to show people that we’re here, and that we come from all over the world, and that we contribute more than people think that we do,” she said.

Jose Antonio Vargas, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist-turned-activist who’s turned his struggles as an undocumented immigrant into a platform for advocacy, took a break from finalizing his taxes in 2019 to share his experience on Twitter.

“Yes,” he wrote, “undocumented immigrants are helping fund the very systems that detain and deport us.”",2023-04-18 18:29:24,Politics

CNN —

Tuesday is Tax Day in America, one of the most stressful days of the year, when many taxpayers will finally end their procrastination, file their federal returns, and hope for a refund from the IRS. But for many of the nation’s wealthiest, it’s just another Tuesday.

Abigail Disney Grasstaken, Roo Castro and Rod Coplin

Morris Pearl Beatrice Mortiz

Tax Day isn’t just a filing deadline — it’s also an annual reminder that the ultra-rich exist in an entirely separate world when it comes to taxes. For us, the loopholes are bigger and the rates are sometimes lower. Meanwhile, the rich keep getting richer, with the wealth of billionaires in particular growing by more than $1.5 trillion over the last few years.

This status quo is unfair, but even more importantly, it’s unsustainable. Such high levels of inequality are pushing our economy and our democracy to their breaking points. That’s why we should examine how we can set our country up for long-term stability and prosperity. And we should start by ensuring that the ultra-rich pay more of what they owe the country that made their success possible.

There are three changes to the tax code that would help us do just that:

Tax all types of income the same for high earners

Right now, the US tax system values money over sweat. If you work hard for your money instead of earning it passively, you’re essentially penalized for it. People who earn a salary pay significantly higher tax rates on their income than wealthy investors who passively earn capital gains income.

Inheriting money is an even better deal. Thanks to former president Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law, the first $12.92 million (or $25.84 million for a married couple) is completely exempt from any estate tax, and the stepped-up basis loophole allows wealthy families to permanently erase millions in capital gains taxes by resetting the market value of those assets to their value at the time of the original owner’s death. With this, it becomes relatively simple for the rich to inherit tens, even hundreds of millions of dollars, and pay almost nothing in taxes. Someone working for that money, on the other hand, would pay over a third of it in federal income taxes.

Why do we have a tax code that says working people should be taxed more than wealthy investors and those who got rich just by virtue of being born into the right family? At the end of the day, money is money, whether you worked for it or whether you inherited it. As an heiress and an investor, we should not be paying lower tax rates than people who earn their money from working.

It’s time for the tax code to treat all income equally by taxing all capital gains over $1 million at the same rates as ordinary income, and replacing our loophole-ridden estate tax with a simpler inheritance tax that treats inherited wealth as income.

Tax wealth or unrealized capital gains

We can’t just focus on income, however, because many of the richest Americans earn basically no taxable income of any kind in a typical year. Capital gains are only taxed when assets are sold, so instead of selling them, the ultra-rich use their assets as collateral to borrow vast sums of money at extremely low interest rates to live on, and then declare little or even negative “income” on their tax forms. This “Buy, Borrow, Die” strategy is a major reason billionaires paid a lower effective tax rate over recent years than working-class families.

By rethinking what is taxable, we can get access to the trillions of dollars of billionaire wealth that is untouchable under our current tax structure. That’s why President Biden has proposed the Billionaire Minimum Income Tax, which would tax the unrealized capital gains of the wealthiest households and why others have proposed wealth taxes on billionaires.

Tax the highest earners more

Finally, one of the most straightforward changes needed is to simply tax the extremely rich more than the merely rich. Our income tax caps out at a top rate of 37% for any income over $578,125 (or $693,750 for married couples). No matter how much more someone makes, they’ll never pay more than 37% in federal income taxes.

While someone earning $600,000 is certainly making enough to live a very comfortable life, they’re in a different world than someone making $600 million a year. In order to reflect the real differences between the rich and the ultra-rich, we need to return to the top rates we had through the most prosperous decades of the 20th century and add significantly more tax brackets. They should reach up to 90% for people making more than $100 million a year.

These three changes certainly won’t fix all our country’s problems on their own, but they would go a long way in stopping the steady flow of our country’s wealth toward a smaller and smaller group of people, a change that would make both our democracy and our economy more stable. The tax code can be a powerful tool for both social and economic change. We just need to use it more effectively.",2023-04-17 19:32:49,Business

CNN —

There are many ways to explore the seven mountains that surround the picturesque UNESCO World Heritage city of Bergen on Norway’s fjord-studded west coast. The newest, however, might well be record-breaking.

A three-kilometer-long (1.8-mile) cycling and pedestrian tunnel has been blasted through the base of Løvstakken mountain and its makers say it’s the longest purpose-built tunnel of its kind.

Fyllingsdalstunnelen, as it’s known, opened on April 15 with a family day of sporting activities, following four years of construction that began in February 2019. The state-funded mega-project cost close to $29 million, or 300 million Norwegian kroner.

“We Norwegians are usually modest people,” Camilla Einarsen Heggernes, a spokesperson for rail company Bybanen Utbygging, tells CNN, “But in this instance we would say that the tunnel is 100% state of the art.”

When you see this sundial, you'll know you're halfway through. Ronny Turøy/Bybanen Utbygging

It takes a little under 10 minutes to whizz through the tunnel by bike and around 40 if strolling by foot. To break up the monotony of the windowless tunnel, there are a variety of art installations throughout, as well as different colors and lighting to help users place where they are on the journey and offer a sense of direction.

At the center point is a “sundial” installation – where the sun definitely will never shine – which shows the time of day, again helping to orientate visitors and also to break up the otherwise long line of sight. The tunnel is otherwise perfectly straight, apart from slight curvatures at entrance and exit.

If you’re wondering how cyclists and pedestrians can use the same space, there are two lanes in the tunnel: a 3.5-meter wide bike lane and a 2.5-meter-wide lane for walkers and runners. “We have laid down a blue rubber flooring throughout the tunnel, similar to an athletic track, explains Einarsen Heggernes. “This makes it more pleasant to use than if one would just walk on asphalt.”

The tunnel was constructed in parallel with a new tram line. NCC/Bybanen Utbygging

The new tunnel came about as a byproduct of Bergen’s second Bybanen tram line, which opened in November 2022. The tram line through the mountain required a parallel evacuation tunnel, so the developers decided to make the new tunnel multipurpose.

Bergen is Norway’s second-largest city and the port city is linked to Oslo, the Norwegian capital, by the 496-kilometer Bergensbanen railway line. This stunning rail journey crosses Europe’s largest high mountain plateau, the Hardangervidda, and its snow-clad vistas were the backdrop for the battle scenes in the “Star Wars” sequel “The Empire Strikes Back.”

While the Fyllingsdalstunnelen is pitching itself as the world’s longest purpose-built cycle tunnel, the reason for that caveat is the 3.6-kilometer-long Snoqualmie Tunnel in Washington, just east of Seattle. This former train tunnel is now a passageway for cyclists, runners and walkers and is part of the 250-mile Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail.

Six European cities made it in CNN Travel’s recent roundup of 10 of the world’s most bike-friendly cities. Copenhagen has 385 kilometers of bike lanes, having introduced its first one way back in 1892. Strasbourg in France has around 6,000 bikes available at self-service stations 24/7 which tourists can use. And the Swiss capital of Bern has a exhilarating downhill trail for riders who feel the need for speed. The best bit is that cyclists can get a funicular up to the top then ride down – no uphill struggle.",2023-04-18 10:44:27,Business
38,Artist rejects photo prize after AI-generated image wins award,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/ai-photo-win-sony-scli-intl/index.html,"CNN —

A German artist has rejected an award from a prestigious international photography competition after revealing that his submission was generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Berlin-based Boris Eldagsen won the creative open category at this year’s Sony World Photography Award with his entry “Pseudomnesia: The Electrician.”

The eerie black and white image shows two women from different generations – the older woman appearing to hang on to the younger woman from behind.

Organizers said they were made aware of some AI involvement, but said there had been “deliberate” attempts to mislead them.

Eldagsen said he hoped his actions would open up the conversation around the issue and lead to “separate competitions for AI-generated images.”

Eldagsen said in a statement shared on his website that he had been a “cheeky monkey” in a bid to open up the conversation around artificially generated images.

“Thank you for selecting my image and making this a historic moment, as it is the first AI generated image to win in a prestigous (sic) international PHOTOGRAPHY competition. How many of you knew or suspected that it was AI generated? Something about this doesn’t feel right, does it?”

He continued: “AI images and photography should not compete with eachother in an award like this. They are different entities. AI is not photography. Therefore I will not accept the award.”

He said he applied “as a cheeky monkey” to find out if competitions “are prepared for AI images to enter. They are not.”

‘Not about winning’

Eldagsen told CNN Tuesday: “It shows that at the moment the photographic world has been taken by surprise after this development that subtly you can create images that look like photography but you don’t need to have the skills and expertise of photographers.”

He said that AI had left many photographers feeling “threatened and afraid that they are going to lose their jobs which will happen.”

Eldagsen said his intention was not to create trouble, but to open up an important conversation.

“It was not about winning anything,” he said. “I was just making a test to see if they were aware – like a hacker who hacks a system not to exploit it, but to see if there are weaknesses.”

In further statements on his website, he said he had informed the organizers of AI involvement.

Organizers said that 2023 had seen the highest number of entries in the awards’ 16-year history. More than 415,000 images were entered across this year’s competitions, with more than 180,000 of them eligible for the professional categories.

Three finalists, as well as five to seven shortlisted photographers, were chosen in each category. The selected images were shot by photographers from more than 30 countries in locations ranging from an abandoned cement factory in China to a fish market in Somalia.

‘Misleading’ claims

The World Photography Organisation, which runs the competition, told CNN in a statement Tuesday that, during the competition’s exchanges with Eldagsen ahead of announcing him as a category winner on March 14, he had confirmed the “co-creation” of this image using AI.

“The creative category of the open competition welcomes various experimental approaches to image making from cyanotypes and rayographs to cutting-edge digital practices,” organizers said.

“As such, following our correspondence with Boris and the warranties he provided, we felt that his entry fulfilled the criteria for this category, and we were supportive of his participation. Additionally, we were looking forward to engaging in a more in-depth discussion on this topic and welcomed Boris’ wish for dialogue by preparing questions for a dedicated Q&A with him for our website.

“As he [Eldagsen] has now decided to decline his award we have suspended our activities with him and in keeping with his wishes have removed him from the competition. Given his actions and subsequent statement noting his deliberate attempts at misleading us, and therefore invalidating the warranties he provided, we no longer feel we are able to engage in a meaningful and constructive dialogue with him.”

The statement said organizers recognize “the importance of this subject and its impact on image-making today.”

“While elements of AI practices are relevant in artistic contexts of image-making, the awards always have been and will continue to be a platform for championing the excellence and skill of photographers and artists working in the medium,” the World Photography Organisation added.

40,Erotic images of seniors show sex and intimacy in new light,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/marilyn-minter-artist-elder-sex/index.html,"CNN —

What does intimacy look like for seniors? There’s no end to sex scenes and other steamy content featuring the young and unwrinkled, but past a certain age, popular culture largely draws a blank — or treats sex as a punchline.

Last year, the artist Marilyn Minter set out to change that, gathering a group of men and women aged 70 and older in her New York studio to showcase a lesser-seen side of sex and relationships. In erotic and colorful images, the seniors are stripped down to lingerie or briefs; they hug, kiss and caress each other in the heat of the moment. The photographs beckon our attention to challenge something still seen as taboo, showing playful, loving moments of pleasure.

“There’s so much contempt for elder sex. Even one of the models that I worked with said, ‘Who wants to see all these?’” Minter recalled in a video call with CNN.

“My whole thought process going into it was that we’re pioneers,” she continued of the unabashedly sexualized context. “Nobody’s ever shot elder people affectionately, and with any kind of elegance. And that was my goal — to make to make them look very desirable.”

A handful of the ensuing images were originally published in the New York Times Magazine, accompanying a candid editorial feature about seniors’ sex lives. Minter is now publishing the series in full in the forthcoming book “Elder Sex,” and exhibiting them at New York gallery LGDR. The exhibition, which opened in April, is her first solo show in the city since the Brooklyn Museum mounted her retrospective “Pretty/Dirty” in 2016, and features highlights from her five-decade-long career, as well as other new bodies of work.

Seeking partners

In “Elder Sex,” Minter utilized one of her signature aesthetics, which she has explored in both hyperrealistic paintings and photographs: jewel-toned, close-cropped compositions of glistening bodies, seemingly shown through the glass of a steamed-up mirror or window. But despite her credentials as one of the most important and boundary-breaking artists today — and despite stars such as Lady Gaga and Lizzo posing for her — Minter couldn’t find enough real couples willing to participate.

“We wanted to (include) all races, all types of sex,” Minter explained. “We had a lot of trouble getting models. I’m 74. I asked all my friends — in mixed-race relationships, in lesbian relationships — and none of them would do it.”

In the end, Minter cast actors along with the few people who had agreed. She paired them together in her studio, photographing them behind a panel of frozen glass — a trick to achieve the steamy, wet look without battling the ephemerality of water vapor. During their shoots, Minter said all her models, who were as old as 89 years old, told her they still had regular, enjoyable sex lives. Their sentiments matched the people interviewed for the New York Times Magazine article, who described deepening intimacy with their partners later in life, as well as learning to navigate and appreciate their needs as their bodies aged.

Minter believes there’s a sense of freedom in sex later in life that, for many people, can take time to reach.

“When you’re young and having sex, it’s a little more performative than it is when you’re 80,” she said. As an older person, “You’re thinking, ‘This is me. Take it or leave it. I’m just going to enjoy myself. I’m not going to fake anything here.’”

Changing attitudes

Minter acknowledges that sex and self-image is fraught for women of all ages — older women are rarely seen or taken seriously as having intimate needs, while for younger women, sexual agency is often a tightrope walk — too much of it and you can be “excoriated and slut-shamed,” Minter said.

“When you’re 25, there’s just so much fear about young women owning sexual agency — it’s just terrifying to people,” she said.

But the artist sees some progress in who gets to be seen as desirable on our television screens, reflecting a burgeoning broader shift in cultural attitudes around sex. She pointed to photographs in People magazine comparing the characters of “The Golden Girls” and “Sex and the City,” who are the same age at the time of the latter’s reboot on HBO Max (which is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery). “The 50s look a lot different in the 2020s!” a caption exclaimed.

Though “The Golden Girls” also delved into romance and intimacy — and was widely-viewed as remarkably sex-positive for its time — there’s a stark contrast in how women in their 50s are presented across the two shows.

“I thought, ‘Okay, here’s why it’s different,” she said. “Number one: People live a lot longer, and they’re healthier… Number two: there’s this thing called Viagra.” Minter laughed, adding: “But who retired at 54? To a home in Florida with three other ladies? What?”

Minter hopes ""Elder Sex"" will serve as a radical body of work and will help normalize sex at older ages. Marilyn Minter/Courtesy of JBE Books & LGDR

She hopes “Elder Sex” will not only serve as a much-needed visual reference for what intimacy can look like at older ages, but will also resonate for people who feel like their desires — and lives — are overlooked.

“It gives permission to people who feel shame about their sexual urges,” she said. “I want this to give them permission to explore that and erase the shame.”

41,"China's economy is off to a solid start, rising 4.5% in Q1 2023",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/economy/china-gdp-q1-2023-intl-hnk/index.html,"Hong Kong CNN —

China’s economy got off to a solid start in 2023, as consumers went on a spending spree after three years of strict pandemic restrictions ended.

Gross domestic product grew by 4.5% in the first quarter from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday. That beat the estimate of 4% growth from a Reuters poll of economists.

But private investment barely budged and youth unemployment surged to the second highest level on record, indicating the country’s private sector employers are still wary about longer term prospects.

Consumption posted the strongest rebound. Retail sales jumped 10.6% in March from a year earlier, the highest level of growth since June 2021. In the January to March months, retail sales grew 5.8%, mainly lifted by a surge in revenue from the catering service industry.

“The combination of a steady uptick in consumer confidence as well as the still-incomplete release of pent-up demand suggest to us that the consumer-led recovery still has room to run,” said Louise Loo, China lead economist for Oxford Economics.

Industrial production also showed a steady increase. It was up 3.9% in March, compared with 2.4% in the January-to-February period. (China usually combines its economic data for January and February to account for the impact of the Lunar New Year holiday.)

Commuters during Beijing's morning rush hour in April 2023 Mark Schiefelbein/AP

Last year, GDP expanded by just 3%, badly missing the official growth target of “around 5.5%,” as Beijing’s approach to stamping out the coronavirus wreaked havoc on supply chains and hammered consumer spending.

After mass street protests gripped the country and local governments ran out of cash to pay huge Covid bills, authorities finally scrapped the zero-Covid policy in December. Following a brief period of disruption due to a Covid surge, the economy has started showing signs of recovery.

Last month, an official gauge of non-manufacturing activity jumped to its highest level in more than a decade, suggesting the country’s crucial services sector was benefiting from a resurgence in consumer spending after the end of pandemic restrictions.

As the economic recovery gains traction, investment banks and international organizations have upgraded China’s growth forecasts for this year. In its World Economic Outlook released last week, the International Monetary Fund said China is “rebounding strongly” following the reopening of its economy. The country’s GDP will grow 5.2% this year and 5.1% in 2024, it predicted.

Private business retreat

However, some analysts believe the strong growth reported in the first quarter was the product of “backloading” of economic activity from the fourth quarter of 2022, which was weighed down by pandemic restrictions and then a chaotic reopening.

“Our core view is that China’s economy is deflationary,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Research, in a Tuesday research report.

If adjustments are made to account for the impact of delayed economic activity, GDP growth in the first quarter could have been just 2.6%, he said.

Some key data released on Tuesday support this idea. For example, private investment was extremely weak.

Fixed asset investment by the private sector increased a mere 0.6% from January to March, indicating a lack of confidence among entrepreneurs. (State-led investment, meanwhile, advanced 10%.) That’s even worse than the 0.8% growth recorded in the January-to-February period.

The Chinese government has resorted to surprising measures to restore confidence among private entrepreneurs, but the campaign has inspired more nervousness than optimism.

The all-important property industry is also mired in a deep downturn. Investment in property declined 5.8% in the first quarter. Property sales by floor area decreased by 1.8%.

“The domestic economy is recovering well, but the constraints of insufficient demand are still obvious,” said Fu Linghui, a spokesman for the NBS, at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. “Prices of industrial products are still falling, and enterprises are facing many difficulties in their profitability.”

Youth unemployment surges

Unemployment continued to surge among the youth.

The jobless rate for 16- to 24-year-olds hit 19.6% in March, up for a third straight month. It was the second highest on record, only behind the 19.9% level reached in July 2022.

The high jobless rate among the youth suggests “slack in the economy,” Yeung said.

“By June, there will be a new batch of graduates looking for jobs. The jobless condition could worsen further if China’s economic momentum falters,” he added.

China’s education ministry has previously estimated that a record 11.6 million college graduates will be looking for jobs this year.

At last month’s meeting of the National People’s Congress, the country’s rubber-stamp parliament, the government set a cautious growth plan for this year, with a GDP target of around 5% and a job creation target of 12 million.",2023-04-18 07:01:12,Business
42,"Even when wives make as much as husbands, they still do more at home",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/16/success/husbands-wives-earning-division-of-labor-pew-survey/index.html,"New York CNN —

Few women will be surprised to learn that even when wives earn about the same as their husbands or more, a new Pew Research Center study finds that they still spend more time on housework and child care, while their husbands spend more time on paid work and leisure.

“Even as financial contributions have become more equal in marriages, the way couples divide their time between paid work and home life remains unbalanced,” Pew noted.

So who’s earning what?

Pew found that in 29% of heterosexual marriages today, women and men earn about the same (roughly $60,000 each). “Husbands in egalitarian marriages spend about 3.5 hours more per week on leisure activities than wives do. Wives in these marriages spend roughly 2 hours more per week on caregiving than husbands do and about 2.5 hours more on housework,” the study notes.

In 55% of opposite-sex marriages, men are the primary or sole breadwinners, earning a median of $96,000 to their wives’ $30,000.

Meanwhile, in 16% of marriages the wives outearn their husbands as the primary (10%) or sole breadwinner (6%). In these marriages women earn a median of $88,000 to their husbands’ $35,000.

Of all of these categories, the only one in which men are reported to spend more time caregiving than their wives is when the woman is the sole breadwinner. And the time spent per week on household chores in those marriages is split evenly between husbands and wives.

In all instances, it’s a big change from 50 years ago — when, for instance, husbands were the primary breadwinner in 85% of marriages.

These are the women most likely to be the biggest earner

Today, which women are most likely to be the primary or sole breadwinners can vary by age, family status, education and race.

For instance, Pew found Black women are “significantly more likely” than other women to earn more than their husbands. For instance, 26% of Black women bring home more than their husbands, while only 17% of White women and 13% of Hispanic women do.

But Black women with a college degree or higher and few children at home are also among the most likely to earn about the same as their husbands.

These numbers are reported against a backdrop of society’s attitudes about who should earn more and how caregiving should be divvied up between spouses.

Nearly half of Americans (48%) in Pew’s survey said husbands prefer to earn more than their wives, while 13% said men would prefer their wives earn about the same as them.

What do women want? Twenty-two percent of Americans said most women want a husband who earns more, while 26% said most would want a man who earns about the same.

Meanwhile, when it comes to having a family, 77% said that children are better off when both parents focus equally on their job and on taking care of the kids. Only 19% said children are better off when their mother focuses more on home life and their father focuses more on his job.

The Pew study is based on three data sources: earnings data from the US Census’ Current Population Survey; data from the American Time Use Survey and a nationally representative survey of public attitudes among 5,152 US adults conducted in January.",2023-04-16 17:29:49,Politics
43,McDonald's is upgrading its burgers,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/business/mcdonalds-burgers/index.html,"New York CNN —

McDonald’s, which has been focusing on upgrading its core items to boost sales, is rolling out a series of changes designed to improve its signature burgers.

Buns will be softer. Cheese, gooier. Onion will be added to patties right on the grill. And the Big Mac sauce? There will be more of it.

“We found that small changes, like tweaking our process to get hotter, meltier cheese and adjusting our grill settings for a better sear, added up to a big difference in making our burgers more flavorful than ever,” said chef Chad Schafer, senior director of culinary innovation of McDonald’s USA, in a statement Monday. The upgrades apply to the Big Mac and the McDouble burger as well as the classic cheeseburger, double cheeseburger and hamburger.

The improvements were first made to burgers in international markets, the company said, and have already arrived in some US cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Phoenix, Las Vegas. They’ll be available nationally by early next year.

The changes follow other improvements to key menu items.

In 2018, McDonald’s announced that it was switching to fresh beef for its Quarter Pounders, a complicated move with a big sales payoff. In 2021, it launched a crispy chicken sandwich to replace previous iterations — a relatively late arrival in the chicken sandwich wars, but one that seems to have resonated with McDonald’s customers. .

“We are gaining market share in both chicken and beef,” thanks to improved burgers and items like the chicken sandwich, said McDonald’s (MCD) CEO Chris Kempczinski during a January analyst call. “In an environment where our customers are looking for the simple and familiar, our core menu items have never been more relevant,” he said. In the US, sales at stores open at least 13 months jumped 5.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022, rising 10.3% for the whole year.

Even the humble cheeseburger is getting an upgrade. McDonald's USA

Focusing on promoting its core menu items, rather than introducing new products, is a way to keep processes simpler and reduce friction in the kitchen. And McDonald’s has been using promotions like celebrity meal platforms and the adult Happy Meal to create buzz around its signature items.

“Throughout 2022, some of our most successful campaign platforms brought our customers closer to the core menu items,” Kempczinski said during the January call.

McDonald’s isn’t the only brand trying to improve its main offerings.

Burger King, which last year announced a plan to turn its business around, has been focusing on improving the Whopper and making it more visible in advertising. In the fourth quarter last year, it held Whopper trainings for franchisees. The brand said in February that the Whopper contributed to higher US sales in that quarter.",2023-04-17 16:31:30,Business
44,Google-parent stock drops on fears it could lose search market share to AI-powered rivals,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/tech/google-ai-search-engine-stock-drop/index.html,"CNN —

Shares of Google-parent Alphabet fell more than 3% in early trading Monday after a report sparked concerns that its core search engine could lose market share to AI-powered rivals, including Microsoft’s Bing.

Last month, Google employees learned that Samsung was weighing making Bing the default search engine on its devices instead of Google’s search engine, prompting a “panic” inside the company, according to a report from the New York Times, citing internal messages and documents. (CNN has not reviewed the material.)

In an effort to address the heightened competition, Google is said to be developing a new AI-powered search engine called Project “Magi,” according to the Times. The company, which reportedly has about 160 people working on the project, aims to change the way results appear in Google Search and will include an AI chat tool available to answer questions. The project is expected to be unveiled to the public next month, according to the report.

In a statement sent to CNN, Google spokesperson Lara Levin said the company has been using AI for years to “improve the quality of our results” and “offer entirely new ways to search,” including with a feature rolled out last year that lets users search by combining images and words.

“We’ve done so in a responsible and helpful way that maintains the high bar we set for delivering quality information,” Levin said. “Not every brainstorm deck or product idea leads to a launch, but as we’ve said before, we’re excited about bringing new AI-powered features to Search, and will share more details soon.”

Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Google’s search engine has dominated the market for two decades. But the viral success of ChatGPT, which can generate compelling written responses to user prompts, appeared to put Google on defense for the first time in years.

In March, Google began opening up access to Bard, its new AI chatbot tool that directly competes with ChatGPT and promises to help users outline and write essay drafts, plan a friend’s baby shower, and get lunch ideas based on what’s in the fridge.

At an event in February, a Google executive also said the company will bring “the magic of generative AI” directly into its core search product and use artificial intelligence to pave the way for the “next frontier of our information products.”

Microsoft, meanwhile, has invested in and partnered with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to deploy similar technology in Bing and other productivity tools. Other tech companies, including Meta, Baidu and IBM, as well as a slew of startups, are racing to develop and deploy AI-powered tools.

But tech companies face risks in embracing this technology, which is known to make mistakes and “hallucinate” responses. That’s particularly true when it comes to search engines, a product that many use to find accurate and reliable information.

Google was called out after a demo of Bard provided an inaccurate response to a question about a telescope. Shares of Google’s parent company Alphabet fell 7.7% that day, wiping $100 billion off its market value.

Microsoft’s Bing AI demo was also called out for several errors, including an apparent failure to differentiate between the types of vacuums and even made up information about certain products.

In an interview with 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai stressed the need for companies to “be responsible in each step along the way” as they build and release AI tools.

For Google, he said, that means allowing time for “user feedback” and making sure the company “can develop more robust safety layers before we build, before we deploy more capable models.”

He also expressed his belief that these AI tools will ultimately have broad impacts on businesses, professions and society.

“This is going to impact every product across every company and so that’s, that’s why I think it’s a very, very profound technology,” he said. “And so, we are just in early days.”",2023-04-17 15:52:19,Business

Read more opinion on CNN.

CNN —

The ruling earlier this month by a Texas federal judge to suspend the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a drug that is used frequently for medication abortions, is very personal for me.

Roxanne Jones CNN

That’s because I took mifepristone years ago during a miscarriage, and it saved my life.

When I was prescribed mifepristone, it had not yet taken center stage in America’s abortion wars. I did not have to make a rushed road trip across state lines to get my medicine, unlike many women who need the drug but live in one of the many states that have restricted access to medication abortion or passed near-total bans on abortion.

I was not forced to set up a secret meet-up with a stranger in order to buy my medicine on the black market, as several women I spoke to recently said they planned to do. Nor did I have to order mifepristone online and find myself navigating the many scammers taking advantage of the current patchwork of state abortion laws in the US.

Mifepristone is one of two drugs used in a medication abortion and the other, misoprostol, was not subject to the ruling by the Texas judge. The two drugs can be administered to someone having a miscarriage, allowing them to terminate the pregnancy when the fetus is not viable.

It happened some years ago: After experiencing more than a day of hemorrhaging during the first trimester of my pregnancy, I visited my ob-gyn, who explained after examining me that my blood pressure was dropping rapidly and the heavy bleeding I was experiencing was an unmistakable sign of a miscarriage.

For many women, being prescribed mifepristone is part of their routine medical care. Not so in my case: As my doctor explained, I was facing a dire medical emergency. I was grateful for the medication that saved my life.

My miscarriage took me by surprise. I had loved being pregnant the first time around, about a decade earlier. And as a healthy woman, I had no reason for fear when I became pregnant again. By the time I was administered mifepristone, I was losing a life that I had already begun to love. And like many other women, despite my level of education or economic status, I could not outrun the statistics that put Black women at higher risk.

Up to one in four known pregnancies will end in a miscarriage. And for Black women, the numbers are alarmingly higher. According to an analysis of 4.6 million pregnancies in seven countries, the risk of a miscarriage for Black women is 43% higher than for White women.

In the Black community, women have traditionally been taught to bear their burdens silently — keep your business to yourself — even after something as devastating as pregnancy loss. We are conditioned to do as I did back then, and keep it moving as we try to outrun the long list of statistics that tell us our lives are in danger from every direction, whether it be from health care risks to societal injustices or other stressors.

During my miscarriage, I was a woman who was afraid, hemorrhaging and in excruciating pain, in desperate need of safe, emergency medical care. Thanks to the administration of mifepristone, I was allowed dignity during my miscarriage. It’s what every woman deserves — whether it be facing a potentially life-threatening miscarriage or seeking an abortion.

I learned from my experience that every miscarriage matters. Women must have access to whatever medicines and counseling we need to help us heal and that includes mifepristone. What we don’t need is to be criminalized by politicians and punitive reproductive laws that have long been out of step with public opinion. Despite the continuing political attacks on women’s reproductive rights, more than 61% of US adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to Pew Research Center.

After the US Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to intervene, Justice Samuel Alito issued a temporary order to preserve the status quo, ensuring access to the drug while giving the justices more time to study the issue.

I am hoping the justices can put politics aside and focus on the science surrounding the safety of mifepristone, a drug that, thankfully, I had access to when my life was in danger. Mifepristone, a synthetic steroid, is even safer than common prescription drugs including penicillin and Viagra.

Following the science demands that, regardless of where you stand on the issue of abortion, consideration must be made for cases like mine and the millions of other women who for years have safely used this medication for complications surrounding miscarriages.

We do not know how the legal fight over medication abortion will unfold. But women across the nation – in blue and red states alike – are watching. Punitive laws like the one signed last week by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis seek to criminalize reproductive care providers. And worse, they are stripping us of rights that men take for granted – it’s unlikely they will be prohibited by the law from making health care decisions about their own bodies.

It must end. And I’m betting that whether it be with our voice or our votes, women will have the last word.",2023-04-18 11:30:00,Politics

CNN —

On Monday, the GOP-controlled House Judiciary Committee — chaired by Donald Trump ally Rep. Jim Jordan — is set to hold a field hearing in New York City called “Victims of Violent Crime in Manhattan.” A statement bills the hearing as an examination of how, the Judiciary Committee says, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s policies have “led to an increase in violent crime and a dangerous community for New York City residents.”

Dean Obeidallah CNN

In response, Bragg’s office slammed Jordan’s hearing as “a political stunt” while noting that data released by the New York Police Department shows crime is down in Manhattan with respect to murders, burglaries, robberies and more through April 2, compared with the same period last year.

In reality, this Jordan-led hearing isn’t about stopping crime but about defending Trump — who was recently charged by a Manhattan grand jury with 34 felonies. Trump pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges stemming from an investigation into a hush-money payment to an adult film actress. The former president also is facing criminal probes in other jurisdictions over efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.

Bragg sued Jordan and his committee last week in federal court, accusing the Judiciary Committee chairman of a “transparent campaign to intimidate and attack” his office for its investigation and prosecution of Trump by making demands for confidential documents and testimony.

While Jordan and his committee appear focused on discrediting the investigation into Trump, why aren’t they looking into two recent bombshell reports by ProPublica that raised red flags about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ financial relationship with GOP megadonor Harlan Crow? After all, the House Judiciary Committee’s website explains that it has jurisdiction over “matters relating to the administration of justice in federal courts” – for which the revelations concerning Thomas fit perfectly.

First, we learned in early April that Crow had provided Thomas and his wife, Ginni, for decades with luxurious vacations including on the donor’s yacht and private jet to faraway places such as Indonesia and New Zealand. That information was never revealed to the public. (In a rare public statement, Thomas responded he was advised at the time that he did not have to report the trips. The justice said the guidelines for reporting personal hospitality have changed recently. “And, it is, of course, my intent to follow this guidance in the future,” he said.)

Then on Thursday, ProPublica reported that Thomas failed to disclose a 2014 real estate deal involving the sale of three properties he and his family owned in Savannah, Georgia, to that same GOP megadonor, Crow. One of Crow’s companies made the purchases for $133,363, according to ProPublica. A federal disclosure law passed after Watergate requires Supreme Court justices and other officials to make public the details of most real estate sales over $1,000.

As ProPublica detailed, the federal disclosure form Thomas filed for that year included a space to report the identity of the buyer in any private transaction, but Thomas left that space blank. Four ethics law experts told ProPublica that Thomas’ failure to report it appears to be a violation of the law. (Thomas did not respond to questions from ProPublica on its report; CNN reached out to the Supreme Court and Thomas for comment.)

The House Judiciary Committee has long addressed issues such as those surrounding Thomas. In fact, the committee is where investigations and the impeachment of federal judges often commence.

One recent example came in 2010 with Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr., whom the committee investigated and recommended for impeachment.

The committee’s Task Force on Judicial Impeachment said evidence showed Porteous “intentionally made material false statements and representations under penalty of perjury, engaged in a corrupt kickback scheme, solicited and accepted unlawful gifts, and intentionally misled the Senate during his confirmation proceedings.” The Senate later found Porteous guilty of four articles of impeachment and removed him from the bench.

Yet the Judiciary Committee has neither released statements nor tweets raising alarm bells about Thomas. Instead, its Twitter feed is filled with repeated tweets whining that C-SPAN won’t cover Monday’s New York field hearing. Worse, the committee retweeted GOP Rep. Mary Miller’s tweet defending Thomas as being attacked “because he is a man of deep faith, who loves our country and believes in our Constitution.”

Jordan’s use of his committee to assist Trump should surprise no one. The House January 6 committee’s report called the Ohio Republican “a significant player in President Trump’s efforts” to overturn the election. The report detailed the lawmaker’s efforts to assist Trump including on “January 2, 2021, Representative Jordan led a conference call in which he, President Trump, and other Members of Congress discussed strategies for delaying the January 6th joint session.” As a result, the January 6 committee subpoenaed Jordan to testify — but he refused to cooperate.

In contrast with the House panel, the Senate Judiciary Committee — headed by Democrats — announced in the wake of the reporting on Thomas that it plans to hold a hearing “on the need to restore confidence in the Supreme Court’s ethical standards.” Beyond that, Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia sent a letter Friday calling for a referral of Thomas to the US attorney general over “potential violations of the Ethics in Government Act 1978.”

The House Judiciary Committee’s website notes, “The Committee on the Judiciary has been called the lawyer for the House of Representatives.” Under Jordan that description needs to be updated to state that the Committee on the Judiciary is now “the lawyer for Donald J. Trump.” And the worst part is that the taxpayers are the ones paying for Jordan’s work on Trump’s behalf.",2023-04-17 11:37:37,Politics

CNN —

In 1917, British analysts deciphered a coded message the German foreign minister sent to one of his country’s diplomats vowing to begin “unrestricted submarine warfare” and seeking to win over Mexico with a promise to “reconquer the lost territory in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona” if the US entered the world war. When it became public, the Zimmerman Telegram caused a sensation, helping propel the US into the conflict against Germany.

“Never before or since has so much turned upon the solution of a secret message,” wrote David Kahn in his classic 1967 history of secret communications, “The Codebreakers.” The Germans had taken great pains to keep their intentions confidential, and the codebreakers in London’s “Room 40” had to do a lot of work to decipher the telegram.

Their efforts stand in stark contrast to the ease with which secrets came tumbling out of a Pentagon intelligence network when 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guard cyber specialist Jack Teixeira allegedly posted hundreds of documents on a Discord chatroom known as “Thug Shaker Central.” The disclosures likely won’t start a war, but they could prove extremely damaging to the US and several of its allies, including Ukraine.

Clay Jones

Teixeira is one of more than one million people who have Top Secret clearance. “The Pentagon has already started taking steps to limit the number of people who have access to such sensitive information,” wrote Brett Bruen, a former US diplomat and Obama administration official. “But much more can be done. … Why do so many people, especially those working short stints in government, have access to information that can shape the fate of nations and their leaders?”

Writing in the Financial Times, Kori Schake saw “some good news.”

“While specific details will be incredibly valuable to Russia and other adversaries, these are not bombshell revelations: journalists had already reported Ukrainian ammunition running low; peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv were never likely; allies have long been aware that the US eavesdrops on them; and the disparaging assessment of Ukraine’s forthcoming offensive may prove no more accurate than previous predictions were.” These will not prove as damaging as the Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning disclosures.

But, she warned, “Technology making data ever more portable, distribution more global and communications more bespoke will make it easier to amass information and distribute it — either privately or publicly.”

Back in the House

Nick Anderson/Tribune Content Agency

In less than a week, the two Democrats expelled from the Tennessee House for their participation in a gun control protest were sent back to office by local officials.

Writing for CNN Opinion, Rep. Justin Pearson noted, “This should be a chastening moment for revanchist forces in Tennessee’s legislature and across the country. Over the long haul, the undemocratic machinations employed to oust us from office are destined to fail. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once famously said that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice. Events this week demonstrated, more than ever, that this is indeed the case…”

“Over two-thirds of Americans — including four out of 10 Republicans — support the kind of common sense gun safety laws that Rep. Jones, Rep. Johnson and I were protesting in favor of, in the wake of the senseless March 27 Covenant School massacre.”

“And yet, calls for common sense gun reform measures fall on deaf ears in our legislature where a Republican supermajority is wildly out of step with most people’s values.”

The politics of gun control have shifted, argued Democratic strategist Max Burns. The NRA’s internal struggles have weakened its influence while Democrats in office, who once feared touching the issue of guns, are increasingly speaking out. And they are making some progress in enacting new state laws, Burns noted.

“The American people decisively support Democratic proposals for addressing the scourge of gun violence. Political watchers who criticized Democrats for talking too much about abortion during the 2022 midterm elections later ate crow after that once-dreaded culture war topic topped the list of voter concerns nationally…

“Biden and the Democrats have the rare opportunity to build yet another winning coalition out of an issue once viewed as political poison.”

Top court calls a halt

Bill Bramhall/Tribune Content Agency

On Friday, the Supreme Court issued an order that temporarily ensured access to a key drug used in many medication abortions. The move gave the justices more time to consider the issue after a Texas federal judge suspended the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion pill 23 years ago.

“If abortion opponents are successful, access to the pill — reportedly used in more than half of abortions in the United States — will be severely undercut,” wrote Michele Goodwin and Mary Ziegler.

“Beyond the dangerous precedent this sets for challenges to other important FDA-approved drugs that some political factions don’t like, the case is an alarming expression of the way right-wing activists are using junk science to bypass the will of the American public and restrict abortion…”

“There are no grounds for challenging mifepristone’s approval, especially 23 years after the fact. The drug received extensive review — more than four years — before FDA approval. Moreover, claims that mifepristone threatens the health of those who take it are unfounded. The drug has a better safety record for use than Viagra and penicillin. Notably, it was available and used for years without incident in Europe.”

Imprisoned

In 1986, Nicholas Daniloff, the Moscow bureau chief for US News & World Report, was seized by Soviet authorities and locked up in Lefortovo prison. He was the last American journalist to be arrested in Russia before last month’s detention of Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich, who like Daniloff, speaks Russian fluently. Gershkovich has been charged with espionage but US officials have concluded that he was “wrongfully detained.”

As David A. Andelman noted, Daniloff’s detention in prison lasted for 13 days before he was put under house arrest and then eventually swapped for an accused Soviet spy. In a conversation with Andelman, Daniloff recalled his reaction when he was imprisoned. “I felt claustrophobic, and I felt like I wanted to get out of there immediately. Of course, there was no chance of that. The door slams, and you have all these thoughts and feelings that run through you, and then you settle down and you realize you’re going to be hanging around that cell for some time.”

Gershkovich’s family in Philadelphia received a letter, handwritten in Russian, from the reporter Friday.

“I want to say that I am not losing hope,” he noted. “I read. I exercise. And I am trying to write. Maybe, finally, I am going to write something good.”

‘Mrs. Maisel’

The Amazon series “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” returns this month for its fifth and final season — and David Perry is here for it. The series brings back memories of visiting his grandparents Irma and Mordy in their “tiny rent-controlled Greenwich Village apartment,” an experience that helped shape his Jewish identity.

“As a Jewish historian,” Perry wrote, “I worry about the tension between preserving the memory of past hardships while not locking our entire history into a tale of oppression. The moments of peace and joy are as vital as the moments of violence. In fact, it’s the periods of peace, of success, of interfaith community, that reveal the terrible truth about the violence: it wasn’t inevitable. People could have made different choices…”

“A show like ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’ lets me revel in my personal New York Jewish heritage while also getting a little break from all the worry. It’s a warm, funny, sexy, extremely Jewish …. comedy that hits me straight in my glossy childhood memories. That isn’t to say the show isn’t also problematic — it most certainly is.”

Jane Goodall’s answer

In the latest installment of CNN Opinion’s “Little Kids, Big Questions” series, 10-year-old Ronan wonders if animals are capable of being smarter than humans. With the help of the John Templeton Foundation, which is partnering on the project, the answer came from Jane Goodall, world renowned for her work with chimpanzees.

“One of the attributes of intelligence is the ability to think and solve problems. In the early 1960s, I was told that this was unique to humans, and only we could use and make tools, only we had language and culture,” Goodall said. “But more and more research has proved that many animals are excellent at solving problems. Many use tools, and many show cultural differences. Some scientists believe that whales and dolphins are communicating with what may be a real language.”

“Although the difference between humans and other animals is simply one of degree, our intellect really is amazing. …bees can count and do math, and that just shows how much we still have to learn about animal intelligence. But humans can calculate the distance to the stars.”

Abbott and Carlson

Nick Anderson/Tribune Content Agency

Earlier this month, a Texas jury convicted Daniel Perry of murder for fatally shooting a Black Lives Matter protester in 2020. The jury deliberated for 17 hours and decided Perry’s action couldn’t be excused under the state’s “stand your ground” law. Prosecutors argued Perry had instigated the incident and they introduced into evidence messages that suggested the shooting was not a spur-of-the-moment act but a premeditated one.

On the evening of the jury verdict, Fox News host Tucker Carlson criticized the decision and told viewers he had invited Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on the show to ask if he would consider pardoning Perry. Others on the right called for Abbott to issue a pardon, and the governor soon responded with an announcement that he would do just that, as long as the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles recommended that Perry should be granted one.

“Trial verdicts are determined by judges and juries,” wrote Dean Obeidallah. “What Abbott is doing is not just wrong, it’s dangerous. His pardon, when it comes, is not what the rule of law looks like.”

What DeSantis and Biden have going for them

Christopher Weyant/Cagle Cartoons

Two of the likeliest candidates for president in 2024 haven’t officially committed yet.

President Joe Biden says he intends to run again but has delayed making a formal announcement. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is making all the moves a presidential contender usually makes, including hawking his new book and visiting New Hampshire, but he hasn’t joined fellow Republicans including former President Donald Trump, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson in declaring.

“DeSantis, who was neck and neck with the former president just a few months ago, may have lost a step or two in more recent polling. But his track record of successful governance in Florida should force GOP voters to think long and hard about what version of their party they want to put forward,” observed Patrick T. Brown.

“A third Trump presidential nomination would indicate that Republican primary voters may prefer style over substance. But if they are serious about not just making liberals mad but advancing actual policy, GOP voters should consider other names, starting with the Florida governor.”

Even without an official announcement by the president, wrote Julian Zelizer, the Biden-Harris campaign is very much under way. “By choosing to lie low while Republicans are gearing up for 2024, Biden is employing his version of what has become known as the ‘Rose Garden Strategy,’ whereby the incumbent campaigns by focusing on the business of being president and showing voters that he is the responsible figure in the race.”

“The president’s understated strategy makes room for Republicans to stoke chaos, tear each other apart and make unforced errors while he remains above the fray for as long as possible. This strategy makes the GOP the focus of the election, allowing Biden to reinforce his message from 2020: do voters want someone who will govern and act in a serious manner or do they want a circus?”

Four years ago, almost to the day, the people of Sudan were celebrating a revolution after overthrowing longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir. Now the East African country faces the possibility of a complete collapse similar to the chaos we see today in Yemen or Libya.

Justin Lynch Courtesy Justin Lynch

On Saturday, rival military factions began fighting each other in the capital of Khartoum. The two sides battled for control of the nation’s airports, bases and military compounds. Violence quickly spilled into the streets and across the country.

Some 45 million Sudanese effectively are held hostage and are unable to venture out of their homes for fear of being killed in the crossfire. At least 180 people have perished in the fighting, including three World Food Programme humanitarian workers.

The conflict pits two bitter rivals and their powerful armed forces against each other. On one side are the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. On the other side are the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemeti.

There is no good side in this conflict. Both have been accused of a long litany of human rights violations.

How did Sudan go from casting off despotic rule and creating a fledgling democracy a few years ago to teetering on the brink of state collapse?

Revolution lost

On April 11, 2019, Sudan’s longtime dictator, Bashir, was overthrown. The cause of Bashir’s removal was months of protests led by Sudan’s unions, which spurred a military coup from the SAF and RSF. Both Burhan and Hemeti joined forces to remove their former boss.

It was a moment of promise because there was hope for democracy. I remember walking around the “sit-in” — a giant carnival of freedom in the middle of Khartoum that protesters had blocked off to demand change. It was electric.

But social movements such as the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) — the union behind the protest — often struggle to translate the momentum of their demonstrations into real political power.

The reason for this is, in part, structural. Social movements such as the SPA are often based on grassroots activism. A dictator can arrest one or two leaders of an organization but not an entire country.

However, once a dictator is overthrown, these kinds of social movements often struggle to build the leadership hierarchy necessary during political negotiations that take place. Like many other movements, Sudan’s protesters were unable to translate mobilization into political power.

Civilian leaders entered into a negotiation with the military over the future of the country shortly after Bashir fell in April 2019. The two sides were not evenly matched. Because of these leadership challenges, the pro-democracy forces struggled to bargain with the disciplined military.

Any momentum that pro-democracy advocates had during the negotiations was stamped out in June 2019 when RSF soldiers violently dispersed the sit-in. More than 100 people were killed.

After the June massacre and the leadership challenges, a transitional constitution was signed in August 2019 that gave the SAF and RSF most of the power in Sudan. Burhan was the head of state, and Hemeti was placed in an elevated political position. Elections were promised in 2022, but few believed they would actually happen.

A legacy of autocracy

The transitional period began in August 2019, and I interviewed Abdalla Hamdok, the civilian prime minister, several times for a book that I co-wrote on Sudan’s revolution. The way that the constitution was written meant that Hamdok had limited power as the prime minister. Burhan was the head of state and wanted to preserve the powers of the SAF.

Hamdok often told me that revolutions come in cycles. The 2019 removal of Bashir was a high point of revolution, and he saw his job as making as many reforms as possible before the low tide of counterrevolution swept him away.

Hamdok found that the legacy of 30 years of dictatorship meant that Sudan’s political and economic models were dilapidated. But Burhan and Hemeti blocked the big reforms that Hamdok wanted to make.

Outside Khartoum violence grew. Parts of Sudan such as Darfur saw a new round of conflict between ethnic groups orchestrated by RSF troops. More than 430,000 people were displaced due to conflict in Sudan, mostly in Darfur.

Soldiers did not hide the atrocities they committed against civilians. I remember drinking tea with a soldier aligned with the RSF at his house in Darfur as he explained why he had recently participated in the burning down of a village from another ethnic group.

The soldier reasoned that a member of his tribe had been killed in an altercation, so the RSF-aligned forces took revenge by torching a village that had been home to 30,000 people. At least 163 people died.

Tensions between the SAF and RSF grew. Burhan viewed Hemeti and his RSF forces as upstart usurpers from Darfur who were undisciplined. Hemeti on the other hand believed that it was time for Darfur to lead Sudan.

Hamdok was on the cusp of beginning to turn the economy around when Burhan and the SAF intervened. As we wrote in the book “Sudan’s Unfinished Democracy,” the potential success of a civilian government was too much for Burhan. In October 2021, Hamdok was removed in a military coup.

International delusion

After the October 2021 coup, the United States and United Nations pushed a worse version of the transitional constitution in Sudan. They argued that it was the best way to bring democracy.

The idea was to restart the transitional period, but I and many others argued it was shortsighted and wouldn’t work. Returning to a government led by Burhan was clearly not going to usher in democracy. If the plan ended in a coup the first time, why would it work the second time?

Some activists stopped partnering with the US and came to see the UN mission as a roadblock to democracy because of these policies. I felt sorry when I spoke with the best American and foreign diplomats, who also understood the international policy in Sudan wouldn’t work. They saw the flaws but felt powerless to dissent and were forced to carry out decisions made many levels above them.

What preceded this weekend’s outbreak of clashes was a controversial part of the international policy that tried to unify the SAF and RSF. The idea was to make a single army, but neither Hemeti nor Burhan wanted to give up the power they had amassed.

The plan to unify the military hadn’t worked in similar contexts. It was a repeat of the 2013 and 2016 unification processes that took place in South Sudan with similarly bloody results. Instead, the tenuous relationship between Burhan and Hemeti boiled over due to the pressure.

What’s next?

It can be easy to look at the recent history of “revolutions” in countries such as Myanmar, Tunisia, Egypt and Sudan and conclude that they eventually backfire. I don’t agree. I learned from Sudanese activists that a nation’s political fortune is an active battle.

49,Michelle Yeoh set to return in new 'Star Trek' movie,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/entertainment/michelle-yeoh-star-trek-section-31/index.html,"CNN —

Live long and prosper, Michelle Yeoh.

After winning a best actress Oscar for her role in “Everything Everywhere All At Once” last month, Yeoh is preparing to step back into the Star Trek universe to reprise her role as Emperor Philippa Georgiou in the new “Star Trek: Section 31” movie.

Yeoh was first introduced as the character in 2017, when the Emmy-winning “Star Trek: Discovery” TV series debuted on Paramount+.

Paramount+ and CBS Studios announced the news on Tuesday. Yeoh will also serve as an executive producer on the project.

Yeoh said in a press release that she is “beyond thrilled” to reprise her role in the “Section 31” movie, which she says “has been near and dear to my heart since I began the journey of playing Philippa all the way back when this new golden age of ‘Star Trek’ launched.”

“To see her finally get her moment is a dream come true in a year that’s shown me the incredible power of never giving up on your dreams. We can’t wait to share what’s in store for you, and until then: live long and prosper (unless Emperor Georgiou decrees otherwise),” she continued.

It truly has been a year of dreams coming true for Yeoh, who made history as the first woman of Asian descent to win an Oscar in the best actress category in March. “Everything Everywhere All At Once” took home seven Oscars that night, including Yeoh’s big win and the top prize for best picture.

“Section 31” will showcase Yeoh’s character as she joins a secret division of Starfleet and is “tasked with protecting the United Federation of Planets and faces the sins of her past,” according to an official synopsis.

“Star Trek: Section 31” will begin production later this year.",2023-04-18 19:11:23,Entertainment
50,Recap: 'Succession' finds dark humor in the aftershocks,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/16/entertainment/succession-season-4-episode-4-recap/index.html,"Editor’s Note: The following contains major spoilers about the fourth episode of “Succession’s” fourth season, “Honeymoon States.”

CNN —

After the shock came the aftershocks, the power vacuum, and perhaps most significantly and impressively, the laughs, as “Succession” pivoted to face life after Logan Roy, in an episode that finally put the HBO show’s title into full flower.

Logan Roy’s abrupt demise left his grown children and subordinates scrambling, with each seemingly humbly offering themselves up to fill the void, while fretting about how the various candidates would play with the company’s board.

At the same time, they mourned the larger-than-life figure they had lost, taking into account that he had treated many of them abysmally. And the fourth hour also marked the return of Logan’s wife, Marcia (Hiam Abbass), in what felt like “Marcia Strikes Back,” while his current and much younger girlfriend, Kerri (Zoe Winter), was bluntly shown the door. (The latter evoked memories of the musical “Evita,” when the title character boots Peron’s mistress, who sings about another suitcase in another hall.)

More than anything, the episode underscored just how brutally funny “Succession” can be, with Shiv (Sarah Snook) reading her father’s obituary and musing, “Dad sounds amazing. I would like to have met dad,” while brothers Kendall (Jeremy Strong) and Roman (Kieran Culkin) hilariously translated the language, with references to Logan having been “a man of his time” equaling “racist.”

The episode also showcased the executives at Waystar Royco, who uncomfortably wondered what to do with a document that included not only Logan’s posthumous wishes but hand-written notes that seemingly specified who he wished to succeed him. They joked, feebly, about tossing the paper in the toilet, while making very clear how much they really wanted to toss the paper in the toilet.

All the knives came out, with Carl (David Rasche) brutally insulting Tom (Matthew Macfadyen), scarcely hiding behind the fact that he was presenting the doubts about Tom’s future as a hypothetical.

Amid that, though, there were also human moments, with the tortured Kendall articulating his conflicted feelings to Waystar executive Frank (Peter Friedman) by saying, “He made me hate him, and he died. I feel like he didn’t like me. I disappointed him.”

“Succession” also underscored the fragility of not just life, but a corporate legacy, with the public-relations folk discussing how to spin and diminish Logan’s involvement in his later years as a means of bucking up the company and its stock price – a maneuver that Kendall ultimately and surreptitiously approved, concluding that it was the sort of smart and ruthless move that his father would have executed.

Questions of succession also appear to be threatening the harmony achieved by Kendall, Shiv and Roman prior to Logan’s exit, with Shiv being left as the odd woman out in a plan to fill the CEO seat just long enough to close the sale to GoJo. Trust doesn’t come easily in series creator Jesse Armstrong’s world, and when Shiv said, “I need to wet my beak,” the assurances from her brothers clearly left the impression how easily that beak could wind up bent out of joint.

Ultimately, after the operating highs of the previous episode, the series successfully turned the page from grieving to the next order of business. And that too, as Kendall put it regarding Logan and the “bad dad” PR leaks, is “what he would do.”",2023-04-17 02:28:12,Entertainment
51,"'Yellowjackets' leans hard into '90s music nostalgia, and we're here for it",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/entertainment/yellowjackets-90s-music/index.html,"CNN —

Of the many dark gifts Showtime’s eerie hit series “Yellowjackets” serves up for us, the juiciest this season is by far the music.

The show – which bounces between a troupe of teen soccer players trapped in the 1990s Canadian wilderness after a plane crash and the survivors’ corresponding adult selves in the present day – embraces nostalgia, incorporating long-cherished tunes from the tail end of last century, with staples from Tori Amos, early Smashing Pumpkins, Massive Attack, Veruca Salt and much more.

In Sunday’s episode of “Yellowjackets,” alt-rock queen Alanis Morissette will debut a version of the show’s theme song, “No Return,” and has already released it as a single.

One of the most unexpected and successful uses of throwback music came in the first episode of Season 2 last month, when Warren Kole’s Jeff had a moment to himself in the car after an intense tryst with wife Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) – during which he rocks out hard to Papa Roach’s “Last Resort” (sure, the track actually came out in 2000, but that doesn’t take away from its retro vibe).

In an interview with CNN, the show’s music supervisor, Nora Felder, explained that the Papa Roach song selection was scripted, and “served as a perfect physical outlet for Warren whose anxious feelings were riding high while sitting alone in his garage.”

Other standout moments in the script, however, are hers to interpret, and Felder relishes the opportunity to match those moments with the right songs from the period.

“I re-immerse myself into the show’s era and spirit of the times as I start to build my playlists for the show,” she said. “The main thing I try to keep in mind is to just stay true to the story and let it tell me what it might need musically.”

Case in point, from the same episode – the placement of Amos’s signature track “Cornflake Girl,” off her groundbreaking 1994 sophomore album “Under the Pink.”

The song – which appropriately has the lyric “Things are getting kind of gross” just as teen Shauna (Sophie Nélisse) is about to ingest something unthinkable – “came to mind pretty quickly as a possibility” to Felder.

“I felt that Amos’s lyrics could serve as a befitting launchpad for the first episode’s ending – not only as a reflection of Young Shauna’s state of mind,” she noted, “but also as a reflection of the past and present moods and mentalities lived out by the other ‘Yellowjackets’ characters in Season 2.”

Felder’s work is challenging, in the sense that there is often an ideal wish-list selection for a song during a certain moment in each script, which then might change either due to something technical or because the needs of the scene evolve during production, as a result of many elements, including the actors’ performances.

“Everyone on the team always wants the best song-select possible to enhance the story,” she said. “When we get to post (production), the common question that comes up among us during the collaboration process is simply, ‘Do we think we can beat this?’”

During that collaborative process, Felder says she doesn’t “believe there is an exact roadmap into how to merge songs with any given scene or story.”

“I always say, ‘Let the picture tell you what it needs.’ (Kind of like the Wilderness I guess?)”

Another moment that feels perfectly melded to the music playing is the now-infamous ‘last supper’ scene from last week’s second episode, which boasts Radiohead’s “Climbing By The Walls” from their mindblowing 1995 album “OK Computer” on the soundtrack.

“The song seems to refer to those unspeakable monsters that can live in one’s head,” Felder noted, referencing the strange collective hallucinations the group undergoes while cannibalizing one of their own. “I can’t think of a more perfect way to hauntingly accent (that) scene, a.k.a. ‘the feast.’”

To drive home just how important music is to the specific ambient feel of “Yellowjackets,” one need look no further than the super creepy Season 2 trailer for the show, which features Florence + The Machine’s exceptional and haunting rendition of No Doubt’s timeless 1995 hit, “Just A Girl.”

“I’m such a huge fan of ‘Yellowjackets’ and this era of music, and this song especially had a huge impact on me growing up, so I was thrilled to be asked to interpret it in a ‘deeply unsettling’ way for show,” band frontwoman Florence Welch said in a statement shared with CNN.

“We tried to really add some horror elements to this iconic song to fit the tone of the show. And as someone who’s first musical love was pop punk and Gwen Stefani, it was a dream job.”

Of her collaboration with “Yellowjackets,” Morrisette, too, felt inspired by the show.

“I see parallels between ‘Yellowjackets’ and my perspective while songwriting: the sheer intensity, that going for the jugular with no fear around going for the profane,” Morissette said in a statement. “I’ve strived my entire career to support the empowerment of women and sensitives, and see the world through the female lens, and what’s so wonderful about this show is that each character is allowed to be dynamic and complex as opposed to oversimplified, reduced versions of women. I feel honoured to be a part of the legacy of ‘Yellowjackets.’”",2023-05-01 23:02:04,Entertainment
52,Jeremy Renner revisits 'the amazing group of people' who helped him recover from his accident,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/16/entertainment/jeremy-renner-update/index.html,"CNN —

Jeremy Renner is continuing his recovery after his devastating snowplow accident in January, and recognizing those who’ve helped him along the way.

The “Rennervations” star posted to the Stories portion of his verified Instagram account ahead of the weekend, showing his recent visit to Renown Regional Medical Center, a Reno, Nevada hospital.

“I got to revisit the amazing group of people who saved my life,” Renner, 52, wrote over a photo of himself posing in the center of a group of people standing in front of a screen that displayed the words “Welcome back!”

He included two other photos with staffers from the medical center, including one outside in front of a Renown sign.

Renner was crushed by a snowplow on New Year’s Day near his Nevada home while trying to clear snow for a relative, and broke several bones including eight ribs, an eye socket, a knee and shoulder. His liver was also pierced, and one of his lungs collapsed.

Last week, the “Hawkeye” star made his first red carpet appearance since the life-threatening incident, for the premiere of his Disney+ series “Rennervations.”

In the show, he and his team help refurbish and repurpose service vehicles to help communities and children in need.

53,Review: 'Barry' takes a whack at its farewell season,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/entertainment/barry-season-4-review/index.html,"CNN —

“Barry” has taken chances from the very beginning, which is certainly true of a fourth and final season that picks up where the third left off, with its hitman-turned-wannabe actor getting arrested. That paves the way for an even darker season that accentuates the show’s ensemble aspect while leaning a little too heavily on blurring lines with flights of fancy.

Thanks to “Succession,” “Barry” won’t be the highest-profile goodbye on HBO this spring, but the Emmy-nominated series isn’t chopped liver either. It’s fair to say, in fact, that while these episodes don’t quite measure up to what’s gone before, even a less-lethal “Barry” is still very, very good.

Bill Hader’s auteur turn as director-producer-star remains one of TV’s most unpredictable series, and the new season has a strong “Better Call Saul” vibe to it, triggered by fallout from the seemingly inevitable fact that Hader’s Barry couldn’t maintain his double life forever.

The consequences of his arrest flare out to both sides of that equation, from his acting teacher Gene Cousineau (as played by Henry Winkler, still a towering mixture of ego and need) and girlfriend Sally (Sarah Goldberg) to the rogues gallery of petty criminals in his orbit, including Fuches (Stephen Root) and NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan), who has improbably found love in the course of his travels, while somehow turning “Barry” into a four-syllable name.

“Barry” has always wrestled with the discomfort of having a protagonist who murders people, and the question of empathizing with its namesake becomes particularly acute in these episodes with the character in prison. When Barry asks, “Are you mad at me?” with an almost-childlike naivete, it’s easy to forget, at least momentarily, some of the horrible things he’s done, even if the revenge-minded Jim Moss (Robert Wisdom) can’t.

Hader (who directed every episode) also excels at darkly comic visual gags, which are augmented in the new season with a few hysterical cameos by actual Hollywood figures, among them director Guillermo del Toro, made even funnier by how random they seem to be.

That said, the show’s surreal digressions and detours into fantasy become more distracting, in a way that feels a little too precious at times. The saving grace, consistently, is the strength of the cast, even if prison creates impediments to their interactions.

HBO made most but not all of the season available, and the series effectively keeps the audience on edge and guessing about where it will all end up, and how (or if) its various threads will connect.

The likelihood of a happy ending for everyone in “Barry”-land never seemed to be in the cards, but Hader and co-creator Alec Berg appear determined to exit on their own terms, as good (mostly) and sporadically frustrating as that might be. That’s why it’s hard to get mad at a show that takes such bracing creative risks, even with a season that isn’t quite the stone-cold killer that it has been.

“Barry” begins its fourth and final season April 14 at 10 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.",2023-04-14 12:33:08,Entertainment

Tejas Dessai, director of research at Global X, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series.

Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

ANDY MILLS (AM): The chairman of Foxconn said the AI boom “still has time to go.” Chip makers such as Nvidia are up on the news today. Where do you see the next phase of artificial intelligence expansion coming from?

TEJAS DESSAI (TD): We expect it to play out in several phases. Currently, the first phase focuses on building the infrastructure that is needed to run, train, and deploy these AI models. And in this particular phase, clearly, you need semiconductors that are specialized — the chips that Nvidia (NVDA) provides or companies like AMD (AMD) or Intel (INTC) are even trying to provide.

Now, on the other hand, you have companies like Broadcom (AVGO) that want to participate in this revolution through ASIC-type chips. There’s a wide area of other chips, as well. But beyond that, we also anticipate the broader data center industry being very well positioned here, as that infrastructure build-out happens at a very large scale, as well. So it’s clearly still early days in this revolution; we expect a large number of companies within the semiconductor value chain to participate in this. But beyond that, you have the hyperscalers with their own play. You have the data center operators and then, eventually, a much broader area of network infrastructure that will play a role in bringing these AI systems to the common masses.

AM: Data centers are going to be a big part of the next phase of AI. What companies do you see taking advantage of it?

Advertisement

TD: What’s happening now is you are seeing an increasing mix of AI-specific workloads come into the data center equation. And AI workloads are extremely computer-intensive. They’re energy-intensive. They need a very different kind of memory, very different kind of storage systems, very different kind of networking solutions, cooling systems, power requirements. So it’s really a breadth of innovation that we are seeing here with companies participating in this across the spectrum.

In the first phase, obviously, you’re starting to see the semiconductor players benefit from this. But as we see more and more AI clusters being deployed, you could see an uptake in memory solutions, in storage solutions, in networking solutions. And you have companies across the spectrum there that play into that equation.

And from there on, we expect companies that specialize in providing comprehensive data center solutions — complete clusters of AI that the average S&P 500 enterprise can leverage. So you talk about data center operators like Equinix (EQIX) or Digital Realty (DLR) or Next DC and several others around the world, we expect these companies to be able to participate in this revolution through infrastructure provisioning.

At the same time, you have your traditional hyperscalers, the FAANG names that build these massive computing facilities and really sell that capacity through their cloud franchises. You have Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) for sure, Google (GOOGL) Cloud, even companies like IBM (IBM) benefiting from that revolution. As they see incremental growth within their cloud franchises, they will be compelled to invest more significantly in building this infrastructure, which, again, benefits a large area of component providers in that list.

AM: Gotcha. So a big driver in economic growth over the last couple of years has been these big tech companies — their stocks are way up. Would you recommend that investors continue to invest in Big Tech going into the fourth quarter and beyond into 2025?



TD: Our advice to our clients has been to focus on adding exposure to the ancillary areas around this new revolution that is forming. Data centers are obviously top of mind. You need to have some sort of exposure to the entire data center value chain if you want to participate within the AI revolution. Beyond that, you can look at the consumer semiconductor ecosystem. You can look at cloud computing ecosystem because ultimately you will see a large breadth of these technology companies participating in this cycle and benefiting from that growth, as well.",2024-10-08 18:29:00,Business

Over the past nine months, sales of vehicles priced at more than $100,000 have fallen by almost 46% compared to a year earlier, according to Boston-based CarGurus, an automotive research and shopping company. Sales of cars in the slightly cheaper $80,000 to $90,000 and $90,000 to $100,000 price ranges have grown only slightly, by 1.3% and 4.2%, respectively.

Now, compare that to the massive surge in purchases of vehicles between $20,000 and $30,000, which has grown by almost 44%. All but one vehicle price range — $0 to $20,000 — below $60,000 increased by double-digit figures.

In the used vehicle market, sales of vehicles between $15,000 and $20,000 grew by 62.6% compared to a year earlier. Sales of used vehicles priced above $30,000 fell dramatically over the past nine months, with a peak decrease of 30.5% for vehicles in the $40,000 to $50,000 range. On the other hand, purchases of used models marked at over $100,000 fell by just 1.4%.

“As we near the end of 2024, it’s clear that consumers are speaking loudly with their wallets,” Kevin Roberts, CarGurus (CARG)’ director of economic and market intelligence, said in a statement. “After years of post-pandemic revenge spending, consumers are becoming more prudent as they face economic uncertainty, still-high interest rates, and vehicle prices that remain elevated,” Roberts added.

Although the U.S. economy is fairly strong, Americans’ perceptions and priorities have changed, leaving many still uncertain, especially in an election year. On the automotive side, CarGurus notes that the impact of the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts won’t provide that much relief to consumers, since vehicle prices remain high. The average vehicle went for $47,870 in August, according to Kelly Blue Book. While the strongest gains were in the cheaper vehicle segments, sales of new vehicles priced between $30,000 and $40,000 and $40,000 and $50,000 have increased by 33% and 20%, respectively.

That’s partially because it’s tough to find really cheap vehicles. But the few models priced below $20,000 that are still sold by automakers, like the Mitsubishi Mirage or Nissan Versa, are soaring in 2024, Motor1 reported.

The company plans to mandate that employees work eight-hour retail shifts at one of its stores every three months, Bloomberg reported, citing a company memo.

Home Depot has a long tradition of having employees spend time in stores, and this program is just an extension of that, a company representative told Quartz in an email. All employees, including senior management and those working remotely, are expected to start taking on a full shift on-site at the beginning of the fourth quarter.

“It’s critical that we all spend time in the aisles engaging directly with customers and understanding the unique opportunities and challenges that our frontline associates face every day,” the company spokesperson said.

While Home Depot claims this move is aimed at supporting retail workers, it may be one way to address concerns about alleged unfair labor practices and compensation. In October 2022, for example, Home Depot Workers United filed a lawsuit alleging unlawful surveillance and worker interrogation in Philadelphia.

Working in retail has always been challenging, partly due to inconsistent schedules, low wages, and demanding tasks. Recently, problems such as theft and difficult customers have made the jobs even tougher. Such has been the case for Target (TGT), who said it plans to continue keeping some essentials, such as deodorant, locked away.

These recent issues have it made difficult to retain employees, prompting retailers such as Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart-owned Sam’s Club (WMT) to increase wages and offer better benefits.

Home Depot’s latest move comes shortly after its second-quarter earnings report revealed that consumers spent less on home improvement this summer. With this decline in spending, the company expects sales to continue to drop in the coming months.",2024-10-08 17:25:00,Business
59,Look inside Clint Eastwood’s California home that just sold for more than $18 million,https://qz.com/clint-eastwoods-former-home-sells-18-55-million-1851667945,"Academy Award-winning actor Clint Eastwood’s former home in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California sold for $18.55 million after going on the market for $21 million earlier this year.

Eastwood resided in the Spanish Revival property in the 1980s and 1990s, which overlapped with his tenure as the small beach city’s mayor from 1986 to 1988. He then sold the home to Frederick O’Such, a now-retired investor, in 1996 for $2.25 million. O’Such subsequently spent two years doing $2.5 million worth of renovations, according to the Wall Street Journal.



“My family has loved living and entertaining at this iconic property for nearly three decades,” said O’Such, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. “It is time for the next owner to enjoy this historic home and share it with their friends and family for years to come.”



The four bedroom, 4.5 bathroom home is 4,442 square feet on an 11,400 square-foot lot. Included in the property’s luxurious amenities are a wine room, a media room, and bathrooms with clawfoot tubs. The house is located just one block away from the ocean and there are views of the water from the property, according to the listing by Tim Allen Properties Team.



“Many long-standing residents in the region have an affinity for the history of this property,” Allen said in a statement shortly after the home was placed on the market.



“The warm and inviting spaces, both inside and outside, take you back in time and are reflective of Carmel’s old-world style and beauty. This private oasis is truly a special property not only because of its history but also for its exquisiteness and privacy.”



Carmel-by-the-Sea is a popular destination for celebrities seeking a break from the limelight. Two years ago, Brad Pitt purchased a $40 million property in Carmel Highlands, an unincorporated community near Carmel-by-the-Sea. Earlier this year, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce visited Carmel-by-the-Sea with fellow celebrity power couple Gigi Hadid and Bradley Cooper.

WeightWatchers, the once-popular points-based weight loss program, said it will be offering its members compounded semaglutide — an off-brand version of the active ingredient in Ozempic (NVO) and Wegovy — for $129 for the first month and then $189 a month for the subsequent months. That’s hundreds of dollars cheaper than Wegovy’s $1,349 monthly price tag.

“At WeightWatchers, we have always combined proven science and personalized support to help our members achieve meaningful, lasting results. With the addition of compounded semaglutide, we are expanding our offering to include a clinical weight management solution that is both accessible and affordable,” said Tara Comonte, interim CEO of WeightWatchers, in a press release.

WeightWatchers stock surged 25% following the news.

This offering comes just a week after Comonte replaced outgoing CEO Sima Sistani in late September. Sistani departed the company as it struggled to adapt to the growing popularity of weight loss drugs.

Sistani joined WeightWatchers in 2022 and led the company for about two-and-a-half years. Under her leadership, WeightWatchers acquired the the telehealth platform Sequence and started offering WeightWatchers members branded weight loss drugs such as Wegovy.

But the bet hasn’t seemed to pay off yet. WeightWatchers’ stock is down more than 88% since the beginning of the year.

The class of weight loss drugs known as GLP-1 treatments have been putting pressure on WeightWatchers. These drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and Type 2 diabetes.

Market leaders Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY), the pharmaceutical giants behind popular GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Zepbound, respectively, have seen their stock prices soar as a result. Novo Nordisk stock has climbed 27% over the past 12 months, while Eli Lilly shares have surged 61%.

WeightWatchers joins other digital health care companies including Hims & Hers, Noom, and Sesame in offering cheaper alternatives to branded weight loss drugs.

Typically, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications — compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient.

Advertisement

But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brand-name drugs such as Wegovy has spurred several digital health care companies to take advantage of that provision.



However, there are risks. The FDA said in July that it had received reports of overdoses related to weight loss drugs, often due to confusion over proper dosing.

And companies hawking compounded weight loss drugs may have to stop when the shortages end. Last week, the FDA updated its drug shortage database, marking the shortage of Eli Lilly’s Zepbound as resolved. Wegovy remains on the list.",2024-10-08 16:59:55,Business

Self-driving truck startup Gatik on Thursday announced plans for what it calls the “most rigorous” third-party review of an autonomous driving system. And it wants others to follow its lead.

Gatik, which calls itself the leader in autonomous middle-miles, works with companies such as Walmart (WMT), Tyson Foods (TSN), and Kroger (KR) to move products on short routes between distribution centers and other locations. The company’s trucks have driven “hundreds of thousands” of miles without a driver and have carried out thousands of deliveries with its partners in the U.S. and Canada.

Advertisement

Gatik is also one of, if not the only, self-driving startup with a perfect safety record — thanks to its cautious software that prioritizes avoiding difficult areas, such as roads near schools or hospitals. But according to CEO Gautam Narang, that’s not enough for Gatik to feel comfortable launching autonomous deliveries across North America.

Advertisement

“In the U.S., there are no specific standards when it comes to proving safety for autonomous vehicles,” Narang said, noting every company uses its own framework for safety. That’s “very important, very helpful, but we believe we can do better. The industry can do better.”

Advertisement

The company has hired two third-party research firms — Edge Case Research and TÜV SÜD — to audit Gatik’s technology and deployment across more than 700 safety portfolios. As the tests are conducted, Gatik said it will be providing public updates on its progress.

“Our Safety Case approach is tangible, comprehensive, and leverages the benefits of Gatik’s [business-to-business] short haul use-case to safely scale across our freight networks,” Gatik’s head of safety, Adam Campbell, said in a statement. He noted that the company has chosen to go “far beyond” the voluntary assessment established by regulators.

‘Incredibly high expectations’

This isn’t the first time an autonomous vehicle company — or group — has tried to set up core guidelines around safety for ethical reasons or to alleviate consumer concerns. Sixty-six percent of drivers fear self-driving vehicles, while 25% are uncertain, according to a March study from AAA.

Advertisement

The Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association — an industry group most major players, including Gatik, are part of — has what it calls the “TRUST” principles, which focus on transparency and a safety-first culture. In 2019, 11 companies banded to try and standardize safety, afraid that one bad actor could collapse the market.

But, by and large, most companies take different approaches to safety.

Some, such as Waabi or Wayve, take an artificial-intelligence-first approach to predict how vehicles move or learn from human behavior. Others, such as Google’s Waymo (GOOGL) or Tesla (TSLA), focus on collecting data from vehicles already on the road. Waymo recently published a series of datasets demonstrating its vehicles’ impact in four markets where the company operates.

Advertisement

As companies such as Waymo, Amazon’s Zoox (AMZN), and General Motors’ Cruise (GM) continue to expand their operations and aim to remove drivers from their cars, scrutiny has increased. Federal regulators launched investigations into Waymo, Zoox, Ford Motor Co., and Tesla earlier this year over issues related to their technologies.

Meanwhile, Cruise is still trying to shake off some consumer and regulatory concerns after a devastating incident almost exactly a year ago.

Advertisement

On Oct. 2, 2023, a human-driven vehicle struck a pedestrian in California, knocking her into the path of a Cruise robotaxi that then dragged the person about 20 feet forward. Last week, the company paid a $1.5 million penalty for failing to properly report the incident.

Since then, Cruise has undergone a series of leadership changes, established an executive board overseeing safety, published a third-party audit, and — for a time — suspended operations, among other things. The company has started to put its cars back on the streets in Houston, Dallas, Phoenix, and California’s Bay Area with a driver behind the wheel. Before returning to commercial operations, Cruise plans to commission another third-party audit.

“We recognize that our communities hold incredibly high expectations for the performance of [autonomous vehicles] on their roads - even higher than the current status quo performance of human drivers,” Cruise Chief Safety Office Steve Kenner said in a statement. “Safety is inextricable from community trust and transparency - in fact it is foundational to establishing that trust - which is why we have raised the bar on ourselves to be a ‘Role Model Driver.’”",2024-10-08 16:02:00,Business

The additional charges Lyft (LYFT) drivers will earn will increase when a rider takes up to five minutes longer than estimated. The company said in February that in its “preferred drivers” pilot program drivers will earn 70% of their riders’ payments at the end of each week.

The new measures come as Lyft is looking to entice new drivers and retain current drivers on its platform. The initiative will allow members with a high driving score to receive more requests from riders, electric vehicle rides with a specific battery range, and an updated earnings dashboard, per Reuters.

Lyft also said that drivers who conclude rides in a particular area where they aren’t eligible to receive riders are “less likely” to get a trip on the way back and will receive additional pay on top of their upfront fare, according to a report from Fast Company.

Vice President Kamala Harris is proposing to expand Medicare benefits for home care services for elders. Her campaign says the proposal will be funded by savings generated from Harris’ plans for lowering government spending on prescription drug prices.

Harris campaign officials told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that the proposal would help cover long-term, in-home services such as home health aides who help with everyday tasks such as bathing and getting dressed.

Harris is set to make a pitch for her plan Tuesday morning during an appearance on ABC’s “The View,” as she tries to reach the growing number of middle-aged voters who are struggling to both raise children and care for their parents.

The Kamala Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Quartz.

Medicare already covers some home health services such as nurses and physical therapists — if beneficiaries meet certain criteria, including being homebound. However, the government program does not currently offer support for 24-hour, long-term home care.

The median cost for a home health aid was $75,500 in 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a survey from the financial services company Genworth (GNW) .

Advertisement

The campaign told the outlet that the new Medicare benefit would be partly paid by some of Harris’ other healthcare plans.

In August, Harris announced a slate of economic proposals that she would prioritize during her first 100 days in office if she were to win the presidential election. The proposals included a number of healthcare policies aiming at lowering prescription drug costs and alleviating medical debt, according to a factsheet shared by her campaign.

Advertisement

Some of Harris’ proposals build upon policies passed by the Biden-Harris Administration in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022 — including a cap on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs and Medicare drug price negotiations.

Harris proposed to speed up Medicare negotiations over prescription drugs — a program first introduced with the IRA. The proposal came just a day after the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the lowered prices of the first 10 prescription drugs that underwent Medicare negotiations.

Advertisement

The IRA gave the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) the power to negotiate the price for brand-name drugs that make up most of Medicare’s prescription drug spending.

The first negotiations resulted in price discounts ranging from 38% to 79%. The new prices are set to go into effect in 2026 and are expected to save people who have Medicare prescription coverage $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs. The health department also said that if the negotiated prices were in effect last year, Medicare would have saved $6 billion in spending.

Geoffrey Hinton, also known as the “godfather of AI,” and John Hopfield were named as the 2024 winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday. Hinton and Hopfield, who both started their work in machine learning in the 1980s, were awarded the prize “for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks,” the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in a statement.

Hopfield is known for inventing a network used in machine learning called the “Hopfield network,” which is used for storing and reconstructing images and other patterns in data using physics, according to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Hopfield’s network was then used by Hinton as the foundation for a new network that uses statistical physics, called the “Boltzmann machine,” which “can learn to recognize characteristic elements in a given type of data,” the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.

“The laureates’ work has already been of the greatest benefit,” Ellen Moons, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said. “In physics we use artificial neural networks in a vast range of areas, such as developing new materials with specific properties.”

Last May, Hinton left his job on Google’s (GOOGL) AI research team to talk openly about his concerns over the risks of AI.

“I console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn’t done it, somebody else would have,” Hinton told The New York Times (NYT).

On Tuesday, Hinton said in response to questions about regrets over his work, that he “would do the same again, but I am worried that the overall consequence of this might be systems more intelligent than us that eventually take control,” Bloomberg reported.

Initially, Toyota’s U.S. production of a three-row electric crossover at a plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, was slated to start late next year. However, a company spokesperson said it’ll be pushed until early 2026.

Still, Toyota is locked in on building the EV crossover in Kentucky in the early part of ’26 along with another EV SUV that’ll be built in a factory in Princeton, Indiana late that same year. From Bloomberg:

The planned expansion of Toyota’s EV lineup in the US from the current two vehicles to as many as seven comes at a time when demand for battery-powered vehicles has slowed. The US rollout is part of a broader goal to sell 1.5 million EVs globally by 2026. To help reach that, Toyota is building a lithium-ion battery plant in North Carolina that is expected to start up in 2025. In February, Toyota said it would spend $1.3 billion to tool up its Kentucky factory for EV production, then in April followed up with an announcement to invest $1.4 billion in the Indiana facility for a second EV. Japan’s Nikkei newspaper reported the delay in EV production at the Kentucky plant earlier Wednesday, adding Toyota also has canceled plans to produce a Lexus brand SUV in North America by 2030.

Right now, Toyota sells the bZ4X and Lexus RZ450e, and they both kind of stink. Hopefully, this next generation of Toyota EVs will be far better than those two. Honestly, they need to be.

We shall see if these plans by Toyota actually pan out. So far, the Japanese automaker has been very slow on the uptake of electric vehicles, hedging on hybrids instead, and that plan has worked out for it.

Though the full revelations remain to be seen, the documentary raises crucial questions: Who is truly behind Bitcoin, and why has its creator gone to such lengths to remain anonymous? Understanding this mystery could shed light on the foundations of the cryptocurrency revolution.

Advertisement

Who is Satoshi Nakamoto, and why did he create Bitcoin?

Satoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous person or a group of people, introduced Bitcoin to the world in 2008. The goal was to create a decentralized digital currency free from the control of governments and central banks.

Advertisement

Unlike conventional currencies, Bitcoin functions on a peer-to-peer network, which means transactions happen directly between users — without an intermediary such as a bank. Bitcoin was officially launched on Jan. 3, 2009, when the first block of transactions, known as the genesis block, was mined.

Nakamoto introduced the concept of limiting the quantity of crypto and making it more valuable to combat inflation, which is why Bitcoin’s supply is limited to a maximum of 21 million coins.

Advertisement

Nakamoto is rich and anonymous

The anonymous creator reportedly possesses approximately 1 million Bitcoin stored in multiple wallets. At the current price, that would be worth around $63 billion.

Advertisement

Nakamoto was involved in the creation of Bitcoin and blockchain until 2010 but has not been heard from since. The inventor of Bitcoin may have wanted to remain anonymous to safeguard their identity from governments, or this anonymity may have been intentional because the core idea behind Bitcoin is to promote decentralized finance. If Satoshi’s identity were revealed, the Bitcoin blockchain may not function as effectively.",2024-10-08 14:25:35,Business

68,10 cities where low mortgage rates have homeowners locked in 'golden handcuffs',https://qz.com/homeowners-mortgage-rates-golden-handcuffs-lock-in-1851667517,"Despite signs that the “lock-in” effect is beginning to fade, many homeowners that snagged rock-bottom mortgage rates during the pandemic are still waiting on rates to fall again before making a move.



Advertisement

This phenomenon keeps current mortgage-holders in what’s known as “golden handcuffs,” where they choose not to move homes — even when they may want or need to — to hang onto their existing rate.

“Having a mortgage with a low interest rate is a fantastic benefit to existing homeowners, but sometimes being in a great position can limit your options,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist, Realtor.com (NWSA). “Although mortgage rates have eased, market rates continue to exceed current rates for most homeowners keeping them locked in ‘golden handcuffs.’”

In 2020 and 2021, mortgage rates fell below 3% and hovered around that mark. Last year, however, rates passed 7%, keeping people locked in to their current arrangements as they looked to wait out the high rates.

Mortgage rates have fallen for the last few months (although they saw a slight uptick last week), with the current 30-year-fixed mortgage rate still hovering somewhere above 6%. Goldman Sachs (GS) expects the 30-year conforming mortgage rate to reach 6.0% by year-end and 6.05% in 2025.

This will likely help loosen up some supply, as homeowners may begin to feel more willing to move as mortgage rates continue to drop. That will be especially true in cities with a higher share of mortgages, where “golden handcuffs” have constrained supply for the last couple of years.

These are the 10 U.S. metropolitan areas that have the highest share of owner occupied homes with a mortgage — and consequently, the cities that could see the most movement as rates fall, according to Realtor.com.",2024-10-08 14:00:00,Business

Tesla investors over at Deepwater Asset Management, an investment firm focused on “transformative technologies and innovators,” published a list of expectations for the upcoming event last week. This list included not one, not two, but three new Tesla models — certainly a bullish expectation from a company that’s released six consumer-facing models ever. Among all that optimism, however, there’s an interesting prediction: Tesla will have a physical, semi-functional prototype of the Robotaxi on display, but the other two vehicles will be naught but renders.

Deepwater portfolio research analyst Brian Baker and managing partner Gene Munster, who penned the list of predictions, admit that the actual release of the Robotaxi is likely far away. The pair quote Musk’s statement on the launch event delay, in which he claimed he “wanted to make some important changes,” stating that this likely means the car is still early in its design phase — don’t expect to see anything production-ready at the reveal. Beyond that, the analysts also talked about regulatory barriers to a fully autonomous vehicle, which are far from codified enough to make sending strangers around in your car while you work a legal possibility.

The company’s latest attempt occurred in June and was largely successful; it marked the rocket’s Super Heavy Booster’s first-ever successful splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico and Starship’s first successful landing burn before it plummeted into the Indian Ocean.

The fifth attempt will seek to attempt the first-ever return to launch site and booster catch, as well as another reentry and landing burn for Starship. SpaceX said its engineers have completely reworked the ship’s heat shield to help the rocket land in the ocean.

For the “catch,” SpaceX will be looking to employ the “chopstick” arms of its launch tower at its site in Texas known as Starbase. SpaceX posted a video in June demonstrating the arms closing around a Super Heavy booster resting on the launch mount.

“With each flight building on the learnings from the last, testing improvements in hardware and operations across every facet of Starship, we’re on the verge of demonstrating techniques fundamental to Starship’s fully and rapidly reusable design,” SpaceX said in a statement.

But it’s unclear whether SpaceX will actually launch its megarocket Sunday, given its issues with the FAA. Last month, SpaceX criticized the agency and said its regulations were holding the company back, adding that the FAA pushed back its fifth Starship test from September to late November because of “superfluous environmental analysis.”

The FAA also proposed fining SpaceX a total of $633,009 over a series of issues last year. Musk responded by accusing the regulator of committing “lawfare” and announcing his company would sue over the fines. In a letter to members of Congress, SpaceX has said it “forcefully rejects” the FAA’s reasoning for the fines.

Sunday, the FAA said it was approving a singular mission for SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket after a mission last week failed to hit its planned target on reentry. The approved mission launched Monday morning.

To do so, the company will roll out an AI assistant powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT GPT-4o, which will answer drivers’ questions about buying and using electric vehicles as opposed to a gas-powered car, executives said at the Go Get Zero sustainability conference in London on Tuesday.

Sachin Kansal, vice president of product management at Uber, said that the driver AI assistant is already in beta testing and will launch with EV-specific questions and other use cases within a few months.

“EV Preference,” another new feature for users, allows customers to hail only fully electric vehicles. That feature will be rolled out on the app over the coming months, and the company believes the option will “help a lot of riders go green,” said Kansal.

“We need more affordable EVs, we need stronger EV mandates, we need incentives for people who are driving the most,” chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said at the conference. “We want to make sure that chargers are available at every community, not just the wealthiest. So we all need to step up.”

Uber is also introducing an “EV Mentor” program that connects EV drivers to EV-curious drivers to answer their questions about making the switch.

As part of that push, Uber Green — the company’s EV and hybrid offering that it first launched in 2020 — is now an EV-only service in 40 cities and states around the world, including major hubs like New York City, Los Angeles, Paris, and Sydney.

These efforts are another step towards the achievement of the company’s sustainability initiatives, which include becoming a zero-emission mobility platform in North America and Europe by 2030 and globally by 2040.

The 31-year-old company’s meteoric rise is largely due to the recent AI boom, which revealed the unexpected potential of its core product, the graphics processing units (GPUs), for AI development.

Originally designed for quickly rendering complex graphics in video games, Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPUs proved well-suited for the demands of AI model training. As tech giants began investing billions in AI research and development, Nvidia swiftly adapted its gaming-oriented chips for AI applications, making them the go-to solution and catapulting the company to the forefront of the AI revolution.

The wealthiest families in the world are increasingly investing their portfolios into risk assets rather than cash, a recent survey of more than 338 family offices revealed.

“Family offices have put cash to work in 2024. Forty-three percent upped exposure to public and private equity,” Citi Private Bank’s (C) 2024 Global Family Office Report read. “Half of respondents increased their allocation to fixed income. Allocations to real estate — which is interest-rate sensitive — saw the most stability for the second year running, despite respondents’ concerns over high interest rates.”

Advertisement

This shift in investments in 2024 is significant because it reflects the attitudes of the wealthiest individuals in the world. Generally speaking, family offices are established by billionaires — though it’s feasible that anyone with more than $500 million in assets could employ the staff necessary to maintain an office, explained Richard Weintraub, head of Citi Private Bank’s Family Office Group in the Americas.

Advertisement

“Last year, over 95% of clients expected a decent return this year, and that happened over the past 12 months,” Weintraub said. “That really gives me confidence. When I look at these sophisticated family offices and what they’re looking forward to, they expect it to be another bullish year in the markets.”



Advertisement

As the number of ultra-wealthy people in the world increases, so do family offices. Today, the amount of wealth held by family offices is an estimated $5.5 trillion, which is already a stark increase from $3.3 trillion in 2019. According to Deloitte projections, the wealth held by family offices will increase by 189% by 2030.



While family offices are increasingly common, experts note it can be challenging to define exactly what they are or how they function.

Advertisement

“The terminology of a family office describes the same terminology as a red car. It doesn’t tell you how big the engine is and how many wheels it has,” Weintraub said. “When you think about someone with a family office, it’s probably someone with extraordinary wealth. And the reason to build it is mostly control.”

Even the size of family offices can vary widely — some families employ a few individuals, while others work with more than 100 advisors.



Advertisement

Weintraub added that while billionaires could work with multiple financial advisors, they then risk the possibility of over or under allocating their wealth, while handling assets through family offices can mitigate that risk. This, in turn, allows families to preserve their assets across multiple generations.



“Your own investment team will follow the guidance that you’ve given them,” Weintraub said. He noted that family offices deal with a number of concerns —including financial investments, philanthropy, and art collecting. He added that a family office “enables you to get everything you need to get done within, within one entity.”",2024-10-08 09:00:00,Business

During the first week of October, a staggering 77% of surveyed Costco locations reported being sold out of the precious metal, a Bloomberg survey noted. The trend, based on calls made to 101 stores in 46 states, highlights a growing shift among shoppers to secure the tangible assets as a hedge against financial instability. The stores surveyed said they had restocked their gold products.

Historically, gold has served as a safe haven during periods of economic turmoil. In times of inflation, geopolitical tensions or market volatility, investors flock to gold, viewing it as reliable store of value. The recent surge in sales for Costco’s gold bars underscores a renewed interest in the timeless investment strategy, which is further highlighted by the price of commodity, which has surged to all-time highs.

Advertisement

Costco began selling the gold bars last September for about $2,000 each to its rewards members. In late January, it started offering one-ounce silver coins in a pack of 25 for $675. Most recently, the retailer has started selling one-ounce platinum bars for $1,089.99.

Gold remains Costco’s best selling precious metal. Earlier this year, the retail giant was reportedly generating approximately $200 million each month by selling the gold bars, according to a research note from Wells Fargo (WFC).

As the demand for gold continues to soar, the implications are significant and retailers like Costco could continue to benefit. More broadly, the buying frenzy not only illustrates a shift in consumer confidence but also raises important questions about the future of investment strategies. Will this trend signify a lasting commitment to gold, or is it merely a temporary reaction to current events?

On Monday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey approved the firm’s bankruptcy plan to use billions in assets it has recovered since its collapse to fully repay customers, Reuters reported. FTX had $12.6 billion in assets in June, but that number could grow to $16.5 billion after the firm is finished with finding and selling its assets, Bloomberg reported, citing court documents. The crypto exchange sold a majority of its stake in artificial intelligence startup Anthropic in March for $884 million, CNBC reported.

“Certainly we benefitted from the bull crypto markets of the last year,” Ken Pasquale, a creditor attorney, told the judge, according to Bloomberg. Pasquale was referring to the state of the crypto market during the exchange’s collapse in November 2022, when customers thought they would only be able to receive a portion of their funds back.

The firm’s preferred shareholders could also get a $1 billion slice from a portion of assets that were seized by federal prosecutors, Bloomberg reported. That money includes $626 million from the sale of FTX co-founders Sam Bankman-Fried’s and Gary Wang’s shares of Robinhood (HOOD) .

Bankman-Fried, who was convicted of fraud, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March for his role in FTX’s collapse.

McDonald’s has filed a lawsuit against Tyson Foods (TSN), JBS, and other major meat processing companies, accusing them of colluding for years to limit beef supplies.

The lawsuit alleges that the collusion allowed the companies to boost their profits while forcing McDonald’s to pay inflated prices for their meat.

Advertisement

McDonald’s claims the companies, including Cargill and National Beef Packing, systematically reduced production levels starting on January 1, 2015, in order to “artificially” drive up market prices. With significant control over the cattle and beef industry, the companies could manipulate prices at their will, the lawsuit says.

Advertisement

“Only colluding meatpackers would expect to benefit by reducing their prices and purchases of slaughtered cattle, fully aware that their conspiracy would shield them from the pressures of a competitive market,” McDonald’s stated.

Advertisement

The “Big Four” beef companies represent the largest meat processing and packing facilities globally. In 2018, they combined to account for about 80% of all fresh and frozen beef sold in the U.S., while the next largest competitor held less than 3% market share.

The lawsuit is part of a broader trend of allegations against the meatpacking giants regarding violations of U.S. antitrust laws and coordinated efforts to manipulate cattle pricing. In June 2020, it was reported that the Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division issued civil subpoenas to Tyson Foods, JBS, Cargill, and National Beef to gather information about their pricing practices, particularly looking at records dating back to January 2015.

Earlier this year, retail giants like Target (TGT) and Kroger (KR) highlighted similar concerns about rising profits and beef prices. In May, cattle ranchers also attempted to challenge the meatpacking giants but failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove they were directly harmed by the alleged anti-competitive behavior.

But his plans to hike tariffs on imports would “more than offset” those tax cuts for all but the richest 5% of Americans, according to a new analysis.

The Republican presidential candidate has pledged to end taxes on social security benefits, tips, and overtime, as well as slash the corporate tax rate to 15% from 21%, which was previously lowered from 35% thanks to his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA). He’s also shown interest in making those tax cuts, which are set to expire next year, permanent while his running mate has floated expanding the Child Tax Credit (CTC).

Advertisement

Together, those provisions could slash hundreds or thousands of dollars off tax bills for American households across every income bracket. However, his pledge to raise tariffs to as much as 20% on all imports and up to 60% or 100% on those from China erases those gains for almost all Americans, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP).



Advertisement

“They would cause substantial price increases on imported goods, severely damage the industries that rely on imports, hurting employment in those industries, and result in price increases for goods for which final production occurs domestically,” the ITEP said of the tariffs, which it noted “would massively disrupt the economy.”

Advertisement

The liberal think tank found that Trump’s policies would give the richest 1% of the country a tax cut of roughly $36,300 if they took effect in 2026. The next richest 4% would see a $7,200 reduction in their taxes, while the rest of the country would see their taxes increase.

The largest increase, $1,790, would be felt by Americans making between $94,100 and $157,500 a year, while those making between $55,100 and $94,100 would pay another $1,530 a year. The poorest 20% of Americans would pay an additional $790 in taxes, while the second-poorest group would have another $1,430 on their bills.

Read More: Donald Trump wants to end taxes on overtime. What else is he promising voters?

But that’s assuming that the 2017 tax cuts are extended past next year to mostly match the TCJA Permanency Act. ITEP’s analysis removed that bill’s provisions related to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction because Trump has said he would not extend the cap on those deductions.

Advertisement

Without that extension, the TCJA will expire at the end of 2025, taking with it the bill’s rules on the standard deduction, individual income tax rates, CTC, SALT, and deduction for small business income. That could increase tax bills by as little as $110 for the poorest Americans or as much as $80,680 for the 1%. In that scenario, not even the wealthiest would be paying less taxes under a Trump administration, according to the ITEP’s figures.

The ITEP’s analysis comes as the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) estimates Trump’s economic plan would add about $7.5 trillion to the federal debt, compared to $3.5 trillion for Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ plan. According to the group, Trump’s tariffs would raise just $2.7 trillion, while his tax cuts would cost $9.1 trillion.

Based on current market prices for high-end AI GPUs, which can range from $10,000 to $40,000 each, Super Micro’s quarterly GPU shipments could represent a potential revenue stream of $1 billion to $4 billion. The server company’s shares are up 65.43% so far this year.

This significant GPU shipment volume dovetails with Super Micro’s advancements in cooling technologies for AI infrastructure. The company’s cooling solutions are “reducing costs and improving performance” at “state-of-the-art AI factories,” Charles Liang, chief executive of Super Micro, said in a statement. The company also said it has “recently deployed” over 100,000 GPUs with its liquid cooling solution to “some of the largest AI factories ever built.”

Super Micro saw its shares fall over 13% in May after it missed analysts’ expectations for revenue in the third quarter.

EV charging company Rove is opening its first location in Santa Ana, California on October 15, KTLA reports. Rove is a company that wants to shake up EV charging by doing something that should have been done in the first place: make them like gas stations.

Rove’s charging stations are loaded with amenities for drivers to use while charging their vehicles. In addition to having room for everyone with 40 fast chargers that can be used by any brand, it offers free wifi, customer lounge and bathrooms.

A big win for people charging is an onsite convenience store complete with drinks and snacks. The downside is that the prices might be high as it’s operated by Gelson’s, a high end gourmet grocery store that’s usually in wealthier cities.

Another downside might be the charging price themselves. In the video by KTLA covering the charging station, you can see that a customer was charged $0.56 per kWh. That might not sit well with some as charging prices in parts of Southern California has been something many have been complaining about recently as some feel they’re too high.

Debs Schrimmer with the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation in California told KTLA that this kind of charging station bolster people’s confidence that they’ll be able to go EV without to much hassle. “By building out the public charging network, it’s giving people the confidence that they’re going to be able to charge their car and be able to get to where they need to go.” Rove plans to open it’s next too locations soon in the cities of Costa Mesa and Torrance.

Fisker can’t seem to do anything right – and that includes closing up shop. Apparently, the La Palma, California headquarters of the now-dead automaker was abandoned and left in “complete disarray” with full-size clay models, automotive equipment, EV batteries and hazardous waste left behind.

This all comes from the facility’s landlord in a new filing submitted to Fisker’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy docket, according to TechCrunch. Tony Lenzini, a representative for Shamrock Properties II, said his client “now faces tens of thousands of dollars in cleanup costs, damage repairs, and what appears to me to be hazardous waste removal.” Listen, I’m very rarely a guy who will stick up for landlords, but that doesn’t sound good. This is all part of an effort to stop Fisker’s attempted lease abandonment because of all the stuff that has been left behind.

Matters get even more confusing when you realize it isn’t even clear who owns this stuff anymore. TechCrunch reports that Shamrock says Fisker sold some of the on-site assets to an auction house called Heritage Global Partners. However, it isn’t clear if that actually ever happened, so now no one knows whose stuff this is.

Photos from Lenzini’s declaration show a number of full-sized clay models for Fisker’s planned upcoming vehicles like the Ronin sports car and Alaska pickup. We can also see trash strewn about, hazardous waste drums and shelves filled with car parts.

Here’s more on the bankruptcy proceedings and what is going on with the La Palma HQ, from TechCrunch:

Lenzini says in his declaration that representatives for Fisker accompanied him on a walkthrough of the facility, which is located in La Palma, California, on September 24. (Fisker shifted its headquarters to this facility after it closed its shiny main Manhattan Beach office in May.) He says they assured him that Heritage Global Partners “would have everything removed” by September 27 — the date Fisker was slated to hand over the property — and that “the building would be cleaned as thoroughly has [sic] possible.” Over those few days, though, Lenzini describes a manic scramble. He says people were “pulling items out of the office and warehouse and loading up trucks and cars” and claims no one was logging what was taken. Meanwhile, HPG President Nick Dove tells TechCrunch that his firm, which purchased some office equipment, furniture and related items, had an agreement with Fisker that was supposed give them access until September 30. However, the company and its moving crew wasn’t not allowed into the building September 30 to retrieve those items. He also says the “chemicals and batteries were not part of our transaction” with Fisker. On September 27, Lenzini says he “witnessed people hurriedly removing property from the building and loading vehicles with various items” but adds that he had “no idea who these people were – whether they were Fisker employees, HGP, Huron staff, or friends of either.” (Huron is the name of the consulting group that has advised Fisker through the bankruptcy process.) Lenzini says these people were “throwing debris everywhere, taking tools, computers, automotive parts, and more, and then returning for another load.” And yet, Lenzini says, the La Palma facility “has been left in complete disarray.” He says there are two 50- to 55-gallon drums, one which references containing oil and another which says contains coolant. He says there are “approximately 20 automotive sized batteries” left on site, too. It isn’t clear if those are electric vehicle battery packs or more typical 12-volt car batteries. Lawyers for Shamrock wrote that Fisker vehicles “were left parked” in the lot outside the facility, but did not specify if they are Ocean SUVs. “My concern is that I do not know what chemicals have been left at La Palma,” Lenzini writes.

Clapping when a flight lands may be a fading tradition, but it’s fully deserved some days. Passengers on a Frontier Airlines flight certainly had a reason for applause on Saturday after the flight from San Diego trailed flames from its landing gear while landing at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. All 190 passengers and seven crew members safely made it to the gate. It’s unclear how the fire started. The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the incident.

Frontier Flight 1326’s pilots declared an emergency while approaching the runway, CNN reports. They told air traffic control that there was smoke in the cockpit. The Clark County Fire Department prepared for whatever descended from the sky. Footage posted on social media shows the Frontier Airbus A321neo on fire as it landed. Specifically, flames were coming from the main landing gear and the tires blew out during touchdown. Firefighters quickly reached the aircraft once it stopped to extinguish the blaze.

The incident became a headache for other passengers at Harry Reid International Airport. The FAA imposed a ground stop at the airport for over three hours, lifting the restriction at 7:00 p.m. local time. Frontier’s status as a low-cost carrier likely had nothing to do with the fire. Maintenance across every major airline has been questioned over the past year. United Airlines diverted to transpacific flights just after takeoff after a wheel fell off one Boeing 777’s landing gear and fluid started gushing out of another 777.

Shares of the company behind Trump’s right-wing social media platform, Truth Social, traded at $19.01 each Monday afternoon, bringing its market capitalization to $3.81 billion.

The upswing reversed some of the stock’s recent losing streak, which has seen the value of the company’s shares plunge nearly 70% since debuting on the Nasdaq in late March.

The former president held a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania — the site of an assassination attempt against Trump in mid-July. Musk, who has been a vocal supporter of the Republican presidential candidate’s latest bid for the White House, joined Trump onstage at the rally.

Hours after the assassination attempt, Musk publicly endorsed Trump for the first time in a post to his social media platform, X (META). At Saturday’s campaign event, Musk said there is “nothing is more important” than voting for Trump, Politico reported.

“President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America,” Musk said. He repeated claims previously made in a post on X late last month, that if Vice President and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris wins, this will be the “last election.”

If elected, Trump has floated appointing Musk to lead a new government commission that would be dedicated to auditing and recommending changes to improve the efficiency of the federal government. For his part, Musk has said he is “willing to serve” in the former president’s cabinet.

Much of Trump Media’s market performance has been dependent on the company’s connection to its namesake — and has become a proxy for his campaign success and election odds.

Trump Media itself has said in regulatory filings that its “success depends in part on the popularity of its brand and the reputation and popularity” of Trump, and that “adverse reactions to publicity relating to [Trump], or the loss of his services, could adversely affect TMTG’s revenues and results of operations.”

The lawsuit, initiated by the parents of 21-year-old Sarah Katz, represented by law firm Kline & Specter PC, marks the first of several legal actions taken against Panera Bread regarding the ultra-caffeinated drink.

In October, Katz’s parents sued the chain, accusing it of failing to adequately warn customers about the beverage’s ingredients. Hours after consuming the drink in September 2022, Katz went into cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead at the hospital.

In addition, another suit has connected the beverage to the death of a man in Florida who reportedly drank three of the Charged Lemonades after work and died while walking home. Furthermore, two additional lawsuits alleged that the drink caused severe heart complications in two healthy individuals.

“The matter was yet to be resolved,” Elizabeth Crawford, a partner at Kline & Specter PC, told the publication, though she did not disclose further details. Panera did not respond to a request for comment from Quartz.

In response to the lawsuits, Panera implemented several changes, including moving the once-self-serve drink behind the counter in January 2024. The chain also introduced noticeable signs that indicated that the Charged Lemonade contained caffeine and was not recommended for consumption by children, pregnant women, and those sensitive to caffeine.

Ultimately, the drink was discontinued in May across the country. It was originally introduced in 2022 as part of Panera’s subscription program, which at the time gave customers a free beverage every two hours.

In June, the chain said it would introduce new beverage offerings in lieu of the the punched-up Lemonade, which at one point contained 390 milligrams of caffeine per serving before being lowered to a maximum of 237 milligrams.",2024-10-07 17:24:26,Business

It all began on Friday, when apparent Cybertruck owner Robert Stevenson posted on X — the social media website owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk — that Geico said they “can no longer insure my Cybertruck.” The X user also included a letter stating that the vehicle “doesn’t meet our underwriting guidelines,” according to Torque News.

But, according to the company, which is the third-largest provider of car insurance by market share, that’s not true.

Advertisement

“GEICO has coverage available nationwide for the Tesla Cybertruck,” the Chevy Chase, Maryland-based company told Quartz in a statement.



Advertisement

The initial claim came a day after Tesla issued its latest recall of the electric pickup due to an issue with the vehicle’s rearview camera, which was fixed through an over-the-air software update, according to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. That notice also revealed that 27,185 Cybertrucks are on the road, a sizable jump from the almost 11,700 units known to be sold as of June.

According to S&P Global Mobility (SPGI), 5,175 Cybertrucks were sold in July alone. That was almost enough to outsell Rivian’s (RIVN) R1T, Ford Motor’s (F) F-150 Lightning, and General Motors (GM)’ Chevy Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, and GMC Hummer EV pickup combined for that month, Jalopnik reported.

The pickup has also been at the center of a large amount of controversy, mostly stemming from dislike of its unique design — which has carried with it no shortage of flaws, from owners getting wounded to trashed deliveries — and Tesla’s issues actually getting it to market.

“There are idiosyncratic factors that can cause swings in GDP from quarter to quarter,” analysts at Oxford Economics wrote in a recent note. “The recent hurricane in Florida and the Carolinas and the Boeing strike have the potential to weigh on GDP growth for the remainder of the year.”

Advertisement

As the strike continues, its economic impact grows larger. There’s already some worry that it will throw off the November jobs report. There are more than 30,000 IAM workers off the job plus Boeing-initiated furloughs and other possible follow-on effects at Boeing suppliers.

Advertisement

The union representing the workers, the International Association of Machinists, confirmed Friday that talks are back on to end the strike.

Advertisement

“We want to inform you that your Union Negotiating Committee and Boeing will meet with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services (FMCS) to continue mediated negotiations on Monday, October 7, 2024, at 9 AM,” the union told its membership.

The current stalemate between Boeing and the IAM comes down to a few percentage points. During previous negotiations, the union had been seeking a 40% raise for its members. Boeing presented a contract offer with a 25% raise. The union rejected that contract and went on strike. The company came back with a “best and final” 30% bump offer. The union rejected that as well.

Although the two sides met at the bargaining table late last month, discussions quickly fizzled out after talks to revive Boeing’s pension made little progress. The stalemate is proving costly for both sides: Boeing cut off striking workers from their company insurance plans last week; until Boeing can get them back on the factory floor, the company should expect to burn about $50 million a day in cash.

“Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery,” a new documentary from HBO (WBD) debuting Tuesday, promises to unmask one of the richest and most mysterious figures on the planet: the creator of Bitcoin.

The anonymous creator, who goes by Satoshi Nakamoto, reportedly possesses approximately 1 million Bitcoin, which are stored in multiple wallets. At the current price, the amount would be worth around $63 billion.

Advertisement

Money Electric’s director, Cullen Hoback, claimed in a post on X sharing the documentary’s trailer to have tracked down the elusive Nakamoto.

Advertisement

“A few of you might have wondered why I disappeared. Well, I was tracking down someone else who disappeared,” Hoback wrote.

Advertisement

He previously directed the documentary series “Q: Into The Storm,” known for exposing Q, the creator of the QAnon conspiracy theory — a far-right political movement that emerged on 8chan in 2017.

This is not the first time someone has claimed to know Nakamoto’s identity. One notable example is Craig Wright, an Australian scientist who has consistently claimed to be Bitcoin’s creator. Earlier this year, he was referred to British prosecutors for allegedly committing perjury.



Advertisement

One day before Money Electric goes live, users on the crypto betting site Polymarket have overwhelmingly put their money on the creator being revealed as American cypherpunk and cryptographer Leonard Harris “Len” Sassaman. Sassaman passed away in 2011, shortly after Nakamoto ceased posting on Bitcointalk, an early forum for cryptocurrency discussions.

Other names have also surfaced, including Adam Back, a prominent figure in the crypto community and one of the earliest cypherpunks who helped lay the ideological groundwork for Bitcoin. However, Back has repeatedly stated that he did not create Bitcoin.

Advertisement

While many in the crypto space speculate that Sassaman is the true creator, Hoback has not confirmed nor denied any speculation, but promised a ‘specific name’ will be revealed on Tuesday.

Why does Bitcoin have such a mysterious history?

Bitcoin is a digital currency created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. The pseudonym refers to the person or group that introduced the concept of Bitcoin in 2008 through a whitepaper. Nakamoto was involved in the creation of Bitcoin and blockchain until 2010 but has not been heard from since.

The inventors of Bitcoin may have wanted to remain anonymous in order to safeguard their identities from governments. Another argument suggests that this anonymity was intentional, as the core idea behind Bitcoin is to promote decentralized finance. If Satoshi’s identity were revealed, the Bitcoin blockchain may not function as effectively.",2024-10-07 16:40:00,Business

The U.S. Supreme Court decided on Monday not to take up Martin Shkreli’s appeal of a $64.6 million penalty he received after raising the price of a lifesaving drug by more than 4,000% during his time as a pharma CEO.

The justices declined to hear Shkreli’s appeal of a lower court ruling that upheld the $64.6 million penalty, which matched the profits he and one of his former companies earned by raising the price of the drug Daraprim in 2015. This was Shkreli’s last opportunity to appeal the multimillion-dollar fine.

Advertisement

The Supreme Court denied the request without providing an explanation, and no justices publicly dissented from the decision, CNBC reports.

Shkreli was the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals — which later became Vyera Pharmaceuticals — when the company acquired exclusive rights to Daraprim, a drug used to treat a parasitic disease called toxoplasmosis that can have serious health effects on pregnant women, infants, cancer patients, and people with AIDS.

Advertisement

In 2015, he raised the price of the drug from $13.50 to $750 per pill, earning him the nickname “Pharma Bro” as he became infamous for the steep price hike.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), along with the states of New York, California, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, filed a civil lawsuit against Shkreli and Vyera Pharmaceutical in 2020 for allegedly blocking competition to Daraprim and costing patients millions of dollars every year.

Advertisement

At the time, Shkreli was already serving a prison sentence for a separate case involving investor fraud. He was released in 2022.

In January 2022, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan ruled in favor of the FTC, permanently banning Shkreli from the pharmaceutical industry and ordering him to repay the profits he made from drastically raising the price of Daraprim.

“Judge Cote’s decision to ban Shkreli for life from the pharmaceutical industry is a significant victory for American consumers,” said FTC Chair Lina Khan at the time. “This precedent-setting relief should be a warning to corporate executives everywhere that they may be held individually responsible for the anticompetitive conduct they direct or control.”

Launched in 2023 to boost foot traffic and sales during the pandemic, the $20 promotion quickly became a crowd-pleaser, but had unintended consequences like long wait times and overstretched kitchens. Ultimately, it created “chaos,” Adamolekun told CNN (WBD) in an interview.

“When you have endless shrimp and you have people sitting and eating for hours, your stress out the kitchen, the hosts, and the servers,” he said.

Advertisement

On top of a hectic atmosphere, the endless deal, served with a side and cheddar biscuits, was a “very expensive product to give away endlessly,” he said.

Advertisement

In May, the seafood chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to address financial obstacles tied to series of failed lease-back agreements, compounded by the financially dubious $20 “endless shrimp” deal, which hurt earnings. Though still available, the deal only runs on Mondays for $25 in-store and excludes holidays.

In early September, Red Lobster announced it was nearing the end of its bankruptcy process, pending court approval of a reorganization plan that would solidify Adamolekun in the CEO role.

As Red Lobster moves forward with its 545 remaining locations, Adamolekun said there are plans to “reduce the menu” to focus on items that allow for better service and food preparation. While there are no plans to plan close more restaurants, he noted that infrastructure and technology investments will take time, with immediate impacts expected.

Red Lobster’s comeback is uncertain as it navigates these changes and adapts its marketing strategies to create a more sustainable business. However, analysts previously told Quartz that the iconic chain has a “tremendous future,” suggesting its goodwill and brand equity could help it “emerge as a healthier business.”",2024-10-07 15:16:00,Business

The SEC said it objects the liquidation plan, citing reasons such as the lack of clarity on how and whether Fisker intends to preserve its corporate records The SEC had sent multiple subpoenas to Fisker as part of the investigation, and may send more, the filing said, without disclosing specific details about the probe. The regulator has requested information from Fisker about where the company’s books and records will be maintained after a settlement plan is adopted but the SEC has not received any response, it said. “The Commission has outstanding investigative subpoenas and may have the need to request or subpoena additional documents in the future relating to its ongoing investigation,” the SEC said.

Regardless of whether Former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris becomes the next president of the United States, there’s at least one clear loser — deficit hawks.

According to a new analysis from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), both candidates are almost guaranteed to raise the federal debt by at least a couple trillion dollars. In the nonprofit’s “central” estimate of the candidates’ economic plans, Harris would add $3.5 trillion in debt through fiscal year 2035, while Trump would double that figure to $7.5 trillion. The current deficit is at around $35.6 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.

Advertisement

According to the CRFB’s low-cost estimate, Harris would not add to the debt at all, while Trump would contribute $1.45 trillion. In the high-cost analysis, Harris could add as much as $8.10 trillion, compared to Trump’s $15.15 trillion.

Advertisement

For comparison, as of June, President Joe Biden added $4.3 trillion to the national debt, largely thanks to his American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Trump’s first term added $8.4 trillion, or $4.8 trillion excluding funding tied to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Advertisement

Much of Harris’s additions to the debt come from her plans to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts for households making less than $400,000 a year, which would add $3 trillion in debt, and expanding the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, which would add $1.4 trillion. Other pricy proposals include her plans to extend the Affordable Care Act’s subsidies, support education, establish national paid leave and medical leave, and expand access and funding for prekindergarten and child care.

Under the central estimate, her proposals would add a combined $7.2 trillion to the deficit. But her pledges to raise some taxes, slash prescription drug prices, and reform international tax rules would slash more than half of that figure. Boosting the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% — effectively rolling back Trump’s 2017 cuts — would provide $900 billion in revenue, according to the CRFB.

Advertisement

Trump’s pledge to extend and modify his 2017 tax cuts would add more than $5.3 trillion in debt, while his other cuts — including ending taxes on social security benefits, as well as taxes on tips and overtime — would add another $3.8 trillion. The candidate’s plan to address immigration by deporting millions of people would add $350 billion.

Read More: Donald Trump wants to end taxes on overtime. What else is he promising voters?

Meanwhile, Trump’s plans to raise tariffs by 10% on all imports — and up to 60% on those from China — would raise $2.7 trillion. Combined with a handful of other measures, he would slash just $3.7 trillion from his projected cost.

“America desperately needs a leader with the wisdom and courage to make correcting our unsustainable fiscal trajectory a major priority,” the CRFB said in its report. “Yet, both the Republican and Democratic candidates for President have put forward campaign plans that would, at best, maintain the status quo and, at worst, add tremendously to our debt and deficits.”



Advertisement

It’s worth keeping in mind that these are estimates and don’t necessarily include every aspect of the candidates’ plans. The CRFB notes that there is some uncertainty in how some proposals would be installed. Trump’s plans to cut taxes on overtime pay could reduce revenue by between $1.7 trillion and $6 trillion from fiscal year 2026 through 2035, depending on how it’s implemented, according an earlier analysis from the group.

Although many voters don’t tend to consider the federal debt or deficit when they head to the ballot box, it’s a big concern for some high-profile executives. JPMorgan’s (JPM) Jamie Dimon has warned that the U.S. should deal with the federal deficit sooner than later before it becomes a problem, while Citadel CEO Ken Griffin has called it “a growing concern that cannot be overlooked.”

Former President Donald Trump has been publicly critical of the sitting president’s signature climate bill and its benefits for clean energy. But even the oil lobby apparently wants to save the Inflation Reduction Act — just without some of the benefits for rival industries and products.

Executives at oil giants Exxon Mobil (XOM), Phillips 66 (PSX), and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) have touted the benefits of the IRA in conversations with Trump’s campaign, The Wall Street Journal reports. The 2022 legislation provides $369 billion in tax breaks and subsidies for clean energy. It’s also pushed companies — including those in the oil industry — to invest $128 billion in projects working on renewable fuel, carbon capture, and other technology.

Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub in May told the Republican presidential nominee that the IRA’s tax credits have helped the company invest in carbon capture, which allows companies to collect carbon directly from the air, the Journal reports. Exxon, which has pledged to invest $15 billion to slash carbon emissions through new investments, has also told Trump’s team it wants to save parts of the IRA.

Advertisement

The oil lobby would certainly welcome the elimination of some aspects of the IRA, especially tax credits for renewable energy and electric vehicles. The EV industry has been by far the biggest beneficiary of the IRA, which has resulted in $77.7 billion invested through 143 projects.

Advertisement

But, at least publicly, Trump hasn’t made the distinction between what he would cut and what he would save from the bill, although he has been critical of funding for electric vehicle charging infrastructure and EV tax credits. In recent months, he has pledged to rescind any allocated funding that isn’t spent before he potentially returns to the White House and “impose an immediate moratorium” on new spending and grants.

“To further defeat inflation, my plan will terminate the Green New Deal, which I call the Green New Scam,” Trump said last month at the Economic Club of New York, referring to the IRA. “It actually sets us back, as opposed to moves us forward,” he added.

Advertisement

Trump has gone to great lengths to court the oil lobby, which has spent about $200 million on lobbying and donated almost $47 million to Republicans over the past two years, this election cycle.

At a meeting with industry executives in April, he offered a “deal to “immediately reverse dozens” of Biden’s environmental rules if they could raise $1 billion for his campaign. He’s also proposed auctioning off more leases for oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and reversing restrictions on drilling in the Alaskan Arctic as part of his “drill, baby, drill” promises.

The investment bank now sees the index hitting 6,000 by the end of this year, up from from 5,600 in previous estimates, according to a research note released Friday. Goldman maintained its earnings per share forecast of $241, up 8% for the full year.

The S&P 500 — considered a benchmark for the U.S. stock market tracking the largest companies in the country — has soared more than 20% in 2024 so far, adding more than $8 trillion to its market capitalization.

As the market continues to rally towards new record highs to cap off this year, economic data continues to suggest that the U.S. economy may be out of the woods.

Friday’s jobs report blew estimates out of the water. In September, the U.S. created 254,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate ticked down one percentage point to 4.1%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The agency also revised its July and August job figures upward.

The news helped calm investors’ concerns about a potentially stagnating labor market and economy. On the strong employment data, Goldman cut its 12-month recession odds to just 15%. That brings the investment bank’s probability of an economic downturn back to where it was in June, prior to a spike in the unemployment rate that briefly sent the market into a tailspin.

Goldman also noted that it expects output — as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) — to remain strong and inflation to stay in line with expectations, despite upward pressures like rising oil prices driven by escalating tensions between Israel and Iran.

Inflation has continued to trend towards the central bank’s 2% target. The latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed’s preferred inflation reading, came in at 2.2% in August.

Last month, the Fed’s decision-making arm — the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)— voted to start its highly anticipated interest rate cutting cycle with an aggressive, half-basis-point cut that brought the federal funds rate to 4.75-5.0%.

While Goldman believes that given the latest economic data, the Fed might have opted for a smaller, 25-basis-point cut, “that doesn’t mean the 50bps cut was a mistake,” economists at the bank wrote.

This also set the stage for what will likely be a 25-basis-point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in November.

“We think the FOMC was late to start cutting, so a catch-up that brings the funds rate closer to the levels of around 4% implied by standard policy rules makes sense even in hindsight,” Goldman said. “However, the recent numbers do strengthen our conviction that the next few meetings (including November 6-7) will bring smaller 25bp cuts.”",2024-10-07 12:19:00,Business

Back at the end of the last century, Patrick Drahi was a fledgling French media entrepreneur, a one-time protege of U.S. cable king John Malone. He was intent on building an empire to rival that of his mentor, who borrowed heavily to build two media conglomerates and today controls significant stakes in Sirius XM and Charter Communications.



Advertisement

Within little more than a decade, Drahi, a graduate of the Polytechnique, France’s MIT, had an empire stretching from Israel, across Europe into the U.S., and down to the Dominican Republic. His holdings included France’s oldest phone company and the country’s 24-hour news channel, a chunk of British Telecom, Portuguese mobile phone and cable operators, and mobile phone and TV news networks in Israel.

In 2015, he moved into the U.S., buying Suddenlink, a southwestern cable company, for $9 billion. He bought New York-area cable and internet provider Cablevision for $17.7 billion from the Dolan family, and paid $200 million for Cheddar, a youth-oriented cable business channel. For fun, Drahi, who has a 750 million-euro collection of modern art, bought auction house Sotheby’s in 2019 for $3.7 billion.

Drahi built his empire buying undervalued and underperforming cable and telecom companies, and applying what he and his aides claimed was telecom engineering — lowering costs with better technology and using the ensuing low prices to win customers. In truth, it wasn’t just telecom engineering, but a large dose of financial engineering that grew Drahi’s empire, most of it under the brand Altice. Drahi and his companies borrowed some $60 billion in bonds and bank loans to pay for it all. But rising interest rates, slower-than-expected growth, the pandemic, and poor management combined to push Drahi and his Altice empire to the brink. Now Drahi is engaged in a fierce battle with creditors, but is nearing the end of his rope, as interest payments rise, revenue is coming up short, and few buyers want to refinance his debt.



At a meeting of creditors last fall in Goldman Sachs’ London office, Drahi said everything he owned would be for sale in an effort to cut debt and keep a smaller Altice conglomerate float. “Everything is open, it’s just a question of offer and demand,” Drahi said, according to a transcript of the meeting reported by Bloomberg. “All in man, all in. Plus the Eiffel Tower, OK?”

House of cards

“The house of cards is tumbling like it has never tumbled before,” investment banker Thomas Coudry told Bloomberg at the time.

Advertisement

But more than a year later, Drahi has yet to sell enough of Altice’s holdings to right the ship. In fact, the outlook is so bad that the share price of Altice’s U.S. operations, which had almost $25 billion in debt at the end of June, has dropped 93% since the company went public in 2017. Net income for the first half of the year was down 92% from a year earlier, meaning there’s not much cash floating around to service that debt.



In the U.S., Altice lost 51,000 broadband subscribers in the last quarter, despite building up its fiber-optic network and vastly reducing the number of trips its repair trucks need to make, and the number of calls to its helplines.



Advertisement

Can’t give it up

Across his empire, which Drahi has largely divided into Altice units in several countries, $21 billion of debt comes due by the end of 2027. Yet Drahi seems in no hurry to sell major assets. Sales so far have included various media and data assets in France for about 3.5 billion euros, $1 billion for Teads, a European video ad platform once worth $5 billion, the giveaway of Cheddar to Archetype, with up to $50 million in payments if Cheddar reaches revenue targets, and the sale of a 24.5% stake in British Telecom to India’s Bharti Enterprises for 3.2 billion pounds ($4.2 billion). But that’s still a small fraction of what Altice owes.

Advertisement

Complicating his task is a growing lack of confidence in Drahi’s leadership, exemplified by the arrest last year of his chief lieutenant, Armando Pereira, for allegedly bilking Altice’s various units out of millions of dollars in purchasing scams. Drahi conceded he’d been caught flat-footed by the scheme.



“He built his empire on debt,” Coudry, the banker, told Bloomberg. “And it’s starting to crumple because of it. And he built his group with a small circle of people at the helm, which is also turning against him.”

Sotheby’s struggles

The most fashionable part of Drahi’s empire is Sotheby’s, the 280-year-old auction house that has stood alongside crosstown rival Christie’s as a symbol of wealth, taste, and power. But a major market downturn has left Sotheby’s struggling, and Drahi’s penchant for leveraging his assets may cost him control of the auction house. Leaked data published by The Financial Times in August showed Sotheby’s core income down 88%, amid a 25% drop in the value of art and other items sold in its auctions. A newly-opened Hong Kong office failed to muster enough worthy works to even hold its planned inaugural auction in the Chinese territory last month (Christie’s was able to go ahead with its Hong Kong sales).



Advertisement

Sotheby’s has other ills: Employees and contractors are finding payments and bonuses delayed, The Wall Street Journal reported, and around New York, at least, Sotheby’s employees say morale at the firm is low. A planned move to new quarters at the former home of the Whitney Museum of American Art, designed in the middle of the last century by the brutalist master Marcel Breuer, has been delayed. New York City real estate records indicate the sale hasn’t yet closed, despite Sotheby’s having already agreed to sell part of its current headquarters.



Drahi has also split Sotheby’s into three parts: the auction business, the buildings that house it, and the discrete business of lending money, both to collectors who offer their prizes for auction, and at high rates to buyers who purchase those same works. It’s all part of an effort to keep the market liquid and boost sale prices. But all of those businesses are now in a downturn.



Advertisement

Certainly, Sotheby’s has been the victim of an economic cycle that has hit the art market. That market has been contracting for the past two years after a pandemic-fueled wave of exuberance had stuck-at-home collectors paying high prices to cover their walls in trophy art, said Katya Kazakina, who writes the Art Detective column for industry publication Artnews, and closely follows the auction market. Even though the stock market is still up, few works now in collections are coming on the art market, and that’s pushing prices and auction revenue down.



Headwinds

“The rich people are still very rich, but psychologically, the market is seen as in a downturn and discretionary sellers are not in any rush to consign anything to auction when values have been falling,” Kazakina said in an interview. But part of the pressure on Sotheby’s is of Drahi’s own making, she added. “He’s leveraged other assets, and he’s leveraging Sotheby’s now, [but] auction revenues are down very significantly.”

Advertisement

With the Breuer move still on hold, Drahi agreed last month to take in a new partner and recapitalize the auction house. Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, known as ADQ, has just put $700 million into Sotheby’s for an undisclosed ownership stake, and Drahi himself has put in $300 million. According to the results obtained by the FT, Sotheby’s will use the $700 million to “reduce the company’s leverage” when the deal closes this fall. But with more than $1.8 billion in net long-term debt as of June, Sotheby’s will still be carrying more than $1 billion in long-term debt.



The final countdown?

The overall debt load is staggering, and observers say there’s a good chance Drahi may lose his empire. Secured creditors, including major financial investors BlackRock, Elliott Investment Management, and Pacific Investment Management Co., are pressing for payment and appear tired of the financial engineering that’s moved some assets out of their reach. They’re proposing a new deal that would give them bonds they could convert into stock, potentially taking control of the companies from Drahi. Meanwhile, Drahi is in talks with Apollo Global Management, a fiercely competitive asset manager founded by Leon Black, to borrow enough cash to start paying back his creditors and win time to turn the companies around.

Advertisement

The problem is that, given the vast number of people switching off cable for online subscriptions, and the immense investments needed to keep cable and internet infrastructure up to date, there’s not much chance that Drahi’s various firms can actually generate enough cash to meet their heavy debt load.



Or as Malone, Drahi’s one-time mentor, told CNBC last fall, as Altice’s debt load became visibly stressed, “It’s all toast.”",2024-10-07 10:57:36,Business

The influx of capital into these funds fueled a rapid rise in bitcoin’s value, which soon reached an all-time high, breaking the prolonged stagnation in the cryptocurrency market.

English The next Nvidia? Data center stocks could be a goldmine, strategist says

A few months later, the financial watchdog approved ether spot ETFs, which many analysts predict could attract even greater interest from investors. This optimism stems from the ethereum blockchain’s widespread applications, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (dApps).



Advertisement

Now, the conversation among investors has shifted to what’s next. Will the SEC continue to expand the range of crypto ETFs? Two promising candidates for future ETFs are Solana and XRP. Below, we’ll explore what these potential offerings could mean for the market.

Solana and Solana ETFs: What are they?

Founded in 2017, Solana is a high-performance blockchain network designed to support dApps. Known for its speed, Solana can process transactions at a significantly faster rate than other blockchains such as ethereum. While ethereum handles around 12-15 transactions per second, Solana claims to support up to 50,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchain networks in the space. Additionally, Solana offers lower transaction fees, which enhances its appeal to developers and users.

Thanks to its speed and cost-efficiency, Solana has gained a reputation as a formidable competitor to ethereum — Solana has often been dubbed the “ethereum killer.” Its native token, Solana, or SOL, plays a crucial role in securing the network and providing rewards to participants. As of early October, it is trading at $137, nearly 500% higher than last year, when it was $23.



Solana ETF, if approved, would be an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of SOL, offering investors a way to gain exposure to Solana’s ecosystem without needing to directly purchase and hold SOL tokens. This would allow traditional investors to benefit from Solana’s growth potential through a more familiar investment vehicle.

XRP and XRP ETFs: What are they?

XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, an open-source blockchain. It is used by the Ripple payment network to facilitate cross-border transactions and is designed to act as a bridge currency. It’s important to note that Ripple, the company, operates the network but does not own XRP. Unlike bitcoin, which has a capped supply of 21 million coins, XRP has a total supply of 100 billion tokens. It is currently trading at $0.52, down 3% from the previous year.

If the XRP ETF receives approval from the SEC, it will track the price of XRP, providing investors with a means to gain exposure to the XRP ecosystem without having to directly purchase and hold XRP tokens.



Will Solana and XRP spot ETF get approval?

The SEC has historically taken a cautious approach to cryptocurrency ETFs, prioritizing investor protection and regulatory compliance. However, the recent approval of bitcoin spot ETFs has opened the door for other cryptocurrencies such as Solana and XRP to follow suit.



Advertisement

Earlier this week, cryptocurrency asset manager Bitwise filed for the first spot XRP ETF. Similarly, investment manager VanEck submitted an application to list the first Solana spot ETF in the U.S. earlier this year. Moreover, asset manager 21Shares also filed for a spot Solana exchange, marking the second major application of its kind in 2024.



Currently, several investment products linked to Solana are available, including Grayscale’s Solana Trust (GSOL) and VanEck’s Solana ETP (VSOL), which can be accessed in select regions.

There is growing optimism in the market that new crypto ETFs may receive the green light within this year or next. This shift could enhance investment opportunities in the cryptocurrency space and attract a broader range of institutional and retail investors.

As the landscape evolves, the SEC’s decisions will be closely watched for indications of how it plans to regulate this emerging asset class.

102,Kashmir and Haryana prove India exit polls wrong,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2y4ew10wxo,"Kashmir and Haryana prove India exit polls wrong

EFE Supporters of the National Conference celebrate as the party leads in Jammu and Kashmir

The northern Indian state of Haryana and Indian-administered Kashmir sprang surprises on Tuesday as votes were counted in assembly elections there. Most exit polls had predicted a hung assembly in Kashmir but an alliance of the main opposition Congress and the National Conference Party (NCP) are on course for a landslide in the 90-member house and poised to form a government. In Haryana, which also has 90 seats, predictions of a Congress landslide were upended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which has proved the pollsters wrong. The BJP-led government appears on course to return for a rare third consecutive term in Haryana. The polls in Kashmir are significant as these are first assembly elections there in a decade – and also the first since the federal government revoked the region's autonomy and changed the former state into a federally- governed territory in 2019. Unlike Kashmir - which India and its neighbour Pakistan have fought wars over – Haryana does not often command global headlines. But the tiny state grabs much attention in India as it is next to the capital, Delhi. Along with Punjab, it is called the bread basket of India for its large wheat and paddy farms, and the city of Gurugram is home to offices of some of the biggest global brands such as Google, Dell and Samsung. The results are being watched keenly in India as these are the first state assembly polls since the summer parliamentary election. Analysts say Tuesday’s results will set the tone as the country heads into more regional elections, including in the state of Maharashtra and Delhi, over the next few months.

PTI Modi's BJP is set to return for a third term in power in Haryana

So what happened in Haryana?

Perhaps the best description of what transpired in the state has come from political scientist Sandeep Shastri. “The Congress has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,” he told the BBC. For weeks, political circles had been abuzz that the BJP was facing a huge wave of anti-incumbency and analysts were confidently saying that the party’s government was on its way out. After most of the post-election exit polls predicted a Congress landslide, many said it was an election for the party to lose. Shastri blames the Congress defeat on overconfidence and infighting within the party. “They were confident they would win and became complacent. BJP, on the other hand, worked on issues quietly on the ground and successfully fought anti-incumbency to return to power.” Both parties, he said, tried to form social coalitions by bringing together different caste groups – the results show the majority chose to support the BJP. Shastri says differences between two top Congress leaders - Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Kumari Selja, who were contenders for the chief minister’s post - did not go down well with the voters. Tuesday’s count, however, has been mired in controversy with the Congress accusing the Election Commission (EC) of delaying updating numbers on their website. After party leader Jairam Ramesh submitted a complaint letter to the Election Commission, Selja said her party may still come out on top. “I am telling you… there is something going on. If all goes well, Congress will form the government in Haryana,” she said. But with numbers not on their side, that will likely remain a dream. The EC has denied the allegations.

103,Indian financial aid opens 'new chapter' with Maldives,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly4eq78k5qo,"Indian financial aid opens 'new chapter' with Maldives

Muizzu (left) and Modi (right) held talks on Monday during the Maldives president's visit to India

The Maldivian president was given red carpet treatment after relations soured in recent months. Modi called his visit a ""new chapter"" in ties.

The support includes a $400m currency swap deal and an additional 30bn rupees ($357m; £273m) in another swap agreement which will allow companies to do business in local currencies rather than in US dollars.

The deal was announced after Maldives President Mohammed Muizzu held talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his five-day visit to India.

India has agreed to extend hundreds of millions of dollars in financial support to the Maldives to help strengthen its struggling economy.

""India will always be there for the progress and prosperity of the people of Maldives,"" he said.

The statements - and the Indian financial package - signal a significant improvement in relations between Male and Delhi, which have been strained since Muizzu came to power in November 2023.

Soon after taking over, he chose to travel to Turkey and China - his visit to the latter in January was seen especially as a high-profile snub to India as previous Maldivian leaders traditionally visited Delhi first after being elected.

Around the same time, India was angered by derogatory comments from three Maldivian officials about Modi.

But analysts say the country’s ailing economy has made its leadership mend its ties with India.

The Maldives is staring at a debt default as its foreign exchange reserves have dropped to $440m (£334m), just enough for one-and-a-half months of imports.

On Monday, Muizzu said he held ""extensive discussions"" with Modi to chart ""a path for the future collaboration between our two countries"".

He thanked India and said the budgetary support would be ""instrumental in addressing foreign exchange issues"".

The two countries have also agreed on a deal to start talks on a free trade agreement.

Ahead of his meeting with Modi, Muizzu had told the BBC that he expected India to help the country as it has done in the past.

“India is fully cognisant of our fiscal situation, and as one of our biggest development partners, will always be ready to ease our burden, find better alternatives and solutions to the challenges we face,” he said.

Without referring to his anti-India campaign, he said: “We are confident that any differences can be addressed through open dialogue and mutual understanding.""

This was in contrast to his previous decisions, some of which were seen as a way to reduce Delhi’s influence and forge closer ties with India’s rival China.

In February, his administration allowed a Chinese research ship to dock in the Maldives, much to Delhi’s displeasure. Some saw it as a mission to collect data which could be used by the Chinese military for submarine operations.

Muizzu has however rejected the pro-China tag, calling his policies as “Maldives First”.

But the country also continues to depend on China, which has so far extended $1.37bn in loans.

104,Why are there so many dropped catches at T20 World Cup?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cg78yd0p088o,"The 2024 iteration of the Women's T20 World Cup was moved to the UAE from Bangladesh at short notice because of civil unrest.

Matches are being played at two venues in Dubai and Sharjah. Both have previously regularly hosted men's cricket, in particular.

Dozens of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches were hosted in the UAE during seasons impacted by Covid-19, and Dubai has the lowest catching success rate of the 14 grounds to have hosted more than 10 matches in the tournament since 2020.

In 39 IPL matches, there have been 93 drops from 322 catches - a success rate of 77.5%.

One theory is that the state-of-the-art floodlights in Dubai could be hindering fielders.

Known as the ""ring of fire"", they are built into the stadium's round roof, as opposed to traditional pylon-style light towers. It's a relatively new concept in cricket stadia design, but is used in other sports - particularly football.

They appear lower in a fielder's eyeline and could make it more difficult to track a white cricket ball travelling at speed.

The team with the worst catching percentage in the competition so far are West Indies - they have taken just 33% of their chances, with both of their matches played in Dubai, albeit one during the afternoon.

The team with the best catching percentage are world champions Australia, who played in the day-time in Sharjah.

Sharjah, however, actually has a worse catching success rate during the tournament.

There have been 32 catches and 21 drops in Sharjah (catching success of 60.3%) and 30 catches and 14 drops in Dubai (68.1%).

The ground there has recently been redeveloped, with the floodlights being replaced with LED lights.

It could be the floodlights, it could be that the players are still getting used to playing in the UAE.

One thing to add is that catches are also going down in the day at a similar rate at both venues. Is that because of the bright sun? The searing heat? The design of the stadia?

We don't know for sure - and the sample size is small - but, either way, catching percentages are down 18% on the last Women's World Cup, held last year.

And, as that old saying goes: catches win matches.",2024-10-06 20:01:57,Business
105,Climbers rescued after three days in the Himalayas,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93y147z4pdo,"Climbers rescued after three days on mountain

Fay Manners Fay Manners (right) climbed Chaukhamba mountain with her climbing partner Michelle Dvorak (left)

A British climber who went missing in the Himalayas has spoken of her relief after surviving for two days in ""brutal"" conditions that put her life in danger. Fay Manners, originally from Bedfordshire, and her climbing partner, Michelle Dvorak from the United States, were stranded on Chaukhamba mountain in northern India when the rope lifting their food, tent and climbing equipment snapped, leaving them without supplies. The pair sent an emergency message at more than 20,000ft (6,096m), but search and rescue teams had initially been unable to find them. Ms Manners told the BBC the pair were ""terrified"" as they tried to make part of the descent alone, before being met by rescuers.

Reuters Fay Manners (centre) said she cried when she was found by her rescuers

Ms Manners is an alpinist, a mountain climber who specialises in difficult climbs, and now lives in Chamonix, France. After a loose rock cut the rope being used to haul the pair's bags, Ms Manners said she felt ""despair"". ""I watched the bag tumble down the mountain and I immediately knew the consequence of what was to come,"" she said. ""We had none of our safety equipment left. No tent. No stove to melt snow for water. No warm clothes for the evening. Our ice axes and crampons for retreat back to basecamp. ""No head torch for moving at night."" The pair were able to send a text message to emergency services, prompting a search and rescue.

Reuters A helicopter had made several attempts to find the stranded women but weather conditions were poor

The women took cover on a ledge as it started snowing, sharing the only sleeping bag they had. ""I felt hypothermic, constantly shaking and with the lack of food my body was running out of energy to keep warm,"" Ms Manners said. The next morning a helicopter came to find the pair, but could not locate them - meaning they faced another 24 hours on the mountain. ""They did try to rescue us but the conditions were brutal for the company to operate in. Bad weather, fog, high altitude and they couldn’t find us as the face was so vast,"" she explained.

Fay Manners Fay Manners provided an image showing the approach from the basecamp to the start of the route

After managing to abseil down the mountain face to some melting ice, the two women managed to catch some water in their bottles. Ms Manners said they ""barely survived"" the storm that afternoon and the second night in the cold with no food and only a little water. ""The helicopter flew past again, couldn’t see us. We were destroyed,"" she said. ""We knew we had to try to go down ourselves as the helicopter wasn’t going to help us."" On that second morning they began to cautiously abseil down the rock spur, aware their weak condition could lead to mistakes.

Fay Manners At earlier points of the climb the duo had taken photos demonstrating the tricky terrain they had to navigate

At that point they spotted a team of French climbers coming towards them - rescuers who had heard about their situation from mutual friends. They shared their equipment, food and sleeping bags with the women and contacted the helicopter with an exact location for rescue. Ms Manners said: ""I cried with relief knowing we might survive. ""They supported us to get across the steep glacier that would have been impossible without our equipment crampons and ice axes. ""We would have either frozen to death or attempted to cross the steep glaciers without the right equipment and slipped to our peril. ""Or maybe, maybe the helicopter would finally have found us?""

Fay Manners The climbers used ropes to lift their supplies in steep situations where it was not ideal to carry them on their back

In 2022 Ms Manners was the first woman to make the ascent of the Phantom Direct route on the south face of the Grand Jorasses in Mont Blanc. She has also successfully climbed peaks in Pakistan and Greenland in the past year. Ms Manners has described her ambition to inspire women to pursue an interest in alpinism and pursue mountaineering as a hobby. She said the incident that cut the rope ""was unfortunate and very rare"". ""We did very well to survive and retreat in the way that we did,"" Ms Manners added. She said she felt ""exhausted, mentally destroyed and over tired to the point I can’t sleep"". Now the pair said they planned to eat local Indian food before they could get a flight home to their loved ones.

X/MEA India After Mohamed Muizzu (left) came to power, ties between India and the Maldives became strained

Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu is expected to seek a bailout during his visit to India this week as the archipelago nation stares at an economic crisis with fears of debt default. It’s Muizzu's first official bilateral visit after he was voted to power late last year following a campaign centred on an 'India out' policy, with a promise to reduce Delhi's influence. Since then, ties have been strained between the countries but experts say the visit indicates that the Maldives can't afford to ignore its giant neighbour. The foreign exchange reserves of the Maldives stood at about $440m (£334m) in September, just enough for one-and-a-half months of imports. Last month, global agency Moody’s downgraded the Maldives' credit rating, saying that “default risks have risen materially”. An Indian bailout will bolster the country’s foreign currency reserves.

Soon after he took charge, Muizzu chose to travel to Turkey and China before visiting India - his visit to Beijing in January was seen as a high-profile diplomatic snub to Delhi as previous Maldivian leaders first visited Delhi after being elected. Around the same time, a controversy erupted in India after three Maldivian officials made derogatory comments about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “President Muizzu’s visit is a turnaround in several ways,” says Azim Zahir, a Maldives analyst and lecturer at the University of Western Australia. “Most notably, the visit is a realisation of how dependent the Maldives is on India, a dependency that no other country will find easy to fill,” he says.

The Maldives consists of about 1,200 coral islands and atolls located in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The archipelago has a population of about 520,000 compared to India’s 1.4 billion. As a small island nation, the Maldives depends on its giant neighbour India for most of its food, infrastructure building and healthcare. Delhi and Male have not officially confirmed that a financial package for the Maldives is on the agenda during the visit. But experts believe it will be part of the discussion. “The key priority of Muizzu’s visit is to secure a financial helpline in the form of grant-in-aid and restructuring debt repayments,” a senior Maldivian editor, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC. Muizzu also wants a “$400m currency swap deal sought by the Maldives central bank to shore up depleted foreign exchange reserves”, he added. The ratings agency Moody’s further expressed serious concerns over Male’s financial situation, saying that ""(foreign) reserves remain significantly below the government’s external debt service of around $600m in 2025 and over $1bn in 2026"". The public debt of the Maldives is about $8bn, including about $1.4bn it owes each to China and India. “Despite Muizzu stating on several occasions that China has given a green signal for deferring debt payments for five years, financial assistance from Beijing has not been forthcoming,” the Maldivian editor said. With no other country coming to the rescue, it appears that Muizzu is now reaching out to India to mend strained ties. “It’s about resetting the tone and negative rhetoric from senior officials of Muizzu’s government that has considerably impacted Indian tourist arrivals,” says Zahir.

Reuters Muizzu's state visit to China in January was perceived as a snub to India

India has long wielded influence over the Maldives, whose strategic position in its backyard allowed it to monitor a crucial part of the Indian Ocean. But Muizzu wanted to change that by moving closer to China. In January, Muizzu’s administration gave an ultimatum to India to withdraw about 80 troops based in the country. Delhi said they were stationed there to man and operate two rescue and reconnaissance helicopters and a Dornier aircraft it had donated years ago. In the end, both countries agreed to replace troops with Indian civilian technical staff to operate the aircraft. A month after assuming charge, Muizzu's administration also announced that it would not renew a hydrographic survey agreement with India that was signed by the previous government to map the seabed in the Maldivian territorial waters. Then a row broke out after three of his deputy ministers made controversial comments about Modi, calling him a “clown”, “terrorist” and a ""puppet of Israel"". The remarks set off an uproar and calls to boycott the Maldives on Indian social media. Male said the comments were personal and did not represent the views of the government. The three ministers were suspended from the cabinet. In what was seen as a thinly-veiled criticism of the reaction on Indian social media, Muizzu said at the time: “We may be small, but that doesn’t give you the licence to bully us.”

107,The Polish artist who painted Hindu gods in Indian palaces,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xe17pegrno,"The Polish artist who painted Hindu gods in Indian palaces

Getty Images Stefan Norblin stayed in India for six years, during which time he painted several murals

In the year 1939, as German tanks and soldiers invaded Poland, a famous Polish artist and his film-star wife pawned off their jewellery and fled the country. Stefan Norblin and Lena left behind their dream home, which they were in the process of building, and their entire artistic legacy in exchange for safety. The couple aimed to seek refuge in America and travelled across Romania, Turkey and Iraq, finally arriving in colonial India, where they spent six years. Their lengthy stopover resulted in the unlikely collaboration between the artist and Indian maharajas (rulers), and gave India some of its finest artworks that blend Western aesthetics with Indian iconography. Between 1941 and 1946, several Indian kings commissioned Norblin to decorate their palaces with paintings, and even design their interiors in the art deco style - a modernist style that celebrates innovation and technology. Norblin rose to the occasion by painting beautiful murals of Hindu gods, entire scenes from Hindu epics Mahabharata and Ramayana and even the country's famed tigers, leopards and elephants in his characteristic blended style. His paintings can be found in the Umaid Bhawan Palace in Rajasthan state - the home of the ruler of the erstwhile princely state of Jodhpur, which has now been converted into a luxury hotel - as well as the palace of the rulers of Morbi in Gujarat state. He also painted portraits for the Maharaja of Ramgarh in Bihar state, but these artworks have been lost to time, says Claus-Ullrich Simon, an expert on Norblin, in Chitraanjali - a documentary which chronicles the artist's works in India. His murals are grand and vibrant, infused with a sense of movement and emotion. They depict recognisable characteristics of the art deco style, like minimalist, elongated human figures, geometric shapes and bold colours; but they are fused with innovative interpretations of traditional Indian imagery, including the features and postures of Hindu gods.

Norblin was born in 1892 in Warsaw into a wealthy family of industrialists. His father wanted him to become a businessman and sent him to study commerce in Antwerp, Belgium. But Norblin's interests lay in painting, a gene he probably inherited from his great-uncle who was a descendant of a famous French painter. So, a young Norblin quit his studies and set off for Europe, where he visited numerous galleries and made illustrations for magazines in Belgium, France and England, writes Agnieszka Kasprzak in the article The Unplanned Return of Stefan Norblin. He later returned to Warsaw and took up work as a graphic artist, stage designer and book illustrator and gradually developed a fan-following among the social elite. Norblin was best known for his portraits. He met and married Lena, his second wife, in 1933 and the influential couple lived a comfortable life in Warsaw. But World War Two uprooted them from their homeland and transported them to the shores of far-away India. The couple first arrived in Bombay (now Mumbai) in British India, and were greeted by a confluence of cultures, religions and languages, says architect Rahul Mehrotra in Chitraanjali. Here, the couple set up home and Norblin began exhibiting his work in top galleries, attracting the attention of rich patrons. In the 1930s and 40s, the art deco style was a huge trend in Europe, but it had not yet permeated the architectural landscape of India. But the sons of many of India's maharajas were exposed to the style when they travelled abroad to study. And so, when Maharaja Mahendrasinhji's son was building a new palace in Morvi (now Morbi) - which he christened The New Palace - he wanted it designed and furnished in the art deco style.

He tasked Norblin with beautifying the interiors of the place with his paintings. The artist made massive murals depicting hunting scenes, Hindu god Shiva lost in prayer, portraits of the ruler's ancestors and imagery that captured the flora and fauna of the area. His human figures have a mix of dark and light complexions and a mystical, nymph-like quality. The artist's next big commission came from Umaid Singh, who invited Norblin to decorate and design the interiors of the royal residence in Jodhpur. The request was perhaps the result of a shipping accident, which destroyed the furniture the maharaja had ordered from London, Kasprzak writes in her paper, Polish Artist At The Service of Maharajas. One can see some of Norblin's finest work in the sprawling Umaid Bhawan Palace. Most captivating are his murals of the goddess Durga, who is often depicted riding a lion and slaying a demon. The goddess is also depicted having many hands, each carrying a lethal weapon. In one of Norblin's paintings of Durga, the goddess looks almost like an Egyptian princess; in another, strokes of black paint give shape to the goddess, making her look almost like a shadow streaking across the wall. In one of the rooms called The Oriental Room, Norblin has painted a series of six murals depicting important scenes from the Ramayana, including goddess Sita's abduction by the demon king Ravana and her walking into the fire to prove her chastity to her husband, Lord Ram. Norblin has also designed entire rooms in the palace, including the king's and queen's suites, the sitting room and dining areas.

Getty Images The Supreme Court is hearing petitions seeking to amend a law that says a man cannot be prosecuted for rape within marriage

The Indian government has opposed petitions in the top court that seek criminalisation of marital rape, saying it would be ""excessively harsh"". The federal home ministry told the Supreme Court that ""a man does not have a fundamental right"" to force sex on his wife, but there were enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. The top court is hearing petitions seeking to amend a British-era law that says a man cannot be prosecuted for rape within marriage. Violence within marriage is rampant in India - according to a recent government survey, one in 25 women have faced sexual violence from their husbands.

Marital rape is outlawed in more than 100 countries, including Britain which criminalised it in 1991. But India remains among the three dozen countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where the law remains on the statute books. A number of petitions have been filed in recent years calling for striking down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860. The law mentions several ""exemptions"" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is ""by a man with his own wife"" if she is not a minor. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in modern times and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who commits it. In India, growing clamour to criminalise rape within marriage

Marital rape: Delhi high court gives split verdict United Nations, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have also raised concerns about India's refusal to criminalise marital rape. But the Indian government, religious groups and men's rights activists have opposed any plans to amend the law saying consent for sex is ""implied"" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. The courts have given contradictory judgements, sometimes allowing a husband to be tried for rape while at others dismissing the petition. The case came to the Supreme Court after the Delhi high court in 2022 delivered a split verdict. The top court began hearings in August.

S Jaishnkar will be the first top government official to visit Pakistan since 2015

Relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours have been tense for years and they have fought three wars since they became independent nations in 1947 - two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir.

The trip comes after Mr Jaishankar's Pakistani counterpart attended a similar meeting of foreign ministers from the SCO in India last year - he was the first senior Pakistani politician to visit since 2011.

This will be the first visit by a high ranking Indian minister to Pakistan in nearly a decade.

India's foreign minister S Jaishankar will attend a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Pakistan this month, his ministry has announced.

The SCO is a political union of countries formed to discuss security and economic matters in Central Asia.

The organisation was created by China, Russia and four Central Asian countries in 2001 as a countermeasure to limit the influence of Western alliances such as Nato.

India and Pakistan joined the group in 2017.

While India chaired the SCO in 2023, Pakistan will be hosting this year's summit from 15 October to 16 October.

At a press briefing on Friday, India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal confirmed that Mr Jaishankar will lead the Indian delegation to Pakistan.

The last time an Indian foreign minister visited the nation was in 2015, when Sushma Swaraj attended a security conference in Islamabad and held rare talks with Pakistani officials.

Days later, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also made a surprise trip to Lahore where he met then Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

Ties between India and Pakistan have always been strained but they hit a new low in 2019, when India launched strikes in Pakistani territory, following a militant attack on Indian troops in Indian-administered Kashmir.

Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it. Separatist insurgency in Indian-administered Kashmir has led to thousands of deaths over three decades. India accuses Pakistan of supporting insurgents but its neighbour denies this.

A thaw of relations seemed in sight last year when Pakistan's Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari visited the Indian state of Goa for a SCO meeting.

But Mr Zardari said his visit was ""focussed exclusively on the SCO"" and did not hold any direct talks with Mr Jaishankar during his trip.

In an interview with the BBC at that time, he said that the onus was on India to restart peace talks between the two countries.",2024-10-04 12:41:38,Business
110,How India became a Test cricket powerhouse,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6w0lygq22o,"How India became a Test cricket powerhouse

Getty Images Laxman and Dravid’s epic 376-run stand at Eden Gardens against Australia in 2001 sealed a legendary win

More than 90 years after India’s first Test match at Lord's in 1932, Rohit Sharma’s team has made history. With a win over Bangladesh in Chennai last month, India now boasts more Test victories than losses, standing at 179 wins to 178 defeats across 580 Tests. Cricket writer Suresh Menon explores India's remarkable transformation into a Test cricket powerhouse. In every field of human endeavour, there are moments when circumstances and people align, sparking change. In popular music this happened with the Beatles, where four boys emerged from the same place at the same time and created a new sound. In sport, such changes are usually led by a single player who has around him a bunch who are almost as good. It happened in football with Pele as Brazil won three of four World Cups between 1958 and 1970 with him in the side. With the arrival of a baby-faced Sachin Tendulkar, the fortunes of Indian cricket changed. His supporting cast was just as important to the transformation: Anil Kumble, Javagal Srinath, Zaheer Khan, Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag, VVS Laxman, Sourav Ganguly, Harbhajan Singh and MS Dhoni. Many would find a place in a team of all-time India greats. Before Tendulkar’s debut in November 1989, India had won just 43 Tests and lost more than twice that number out of the 257 matches played. The remaining were draws. In the Tendulkar era, India registered 78 wins against 60 losses out of the 217 matches played. But it was a period when the number of draws - 79 - was still significant. Only seven wins had come in the ""SANE"" countries: South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and England. Draws in these countries were still seen as victory of sorts – the mindset with which India began international cricket.

Getty Images The fortunes of Indian cricket changed with the arrival of Sachin Tendulkar

Domestically, changes were happening. Led by Ganguly, and carried forward by Dhoni, India were discovering players beyond the traditional centres. If you were good enough, it didn’t matter where you were from; you would get your chance. This was despite the cricket board itself and the various local bodies often being drenched in politics. Tendulkar retired in 2013, and since then India have won 58 while losing just 29 Tests of the 106 played. Significantly, there have been only 19 draws. India won back-to-back series in Australia as they matched their rivals for aggression and in self-belief. This was no longer merely a cricketing change now, it was a psychological one. Virat Kohli occasionally went beyond the pale as skipper, but he was passionate about Test cricket and passionate about winning - an attitude that seeped into the team. Set to chase 364 in his first Test as captain in Adelaide in 2014, India nearly pulled it off and lost the match by just 48 runs. It was a turning point. A new approach was created. Kohli, who led India in most Tests, at 68, was allergic to draws. It meant India played positive cricket at all times. Kohli drew just 16% of his Tests, the lowest among the top six captains in history. Even Clive Lloyd had 35% draws.

Getty Images Virat Kohli's intense passion for Test cricket and winning inspired his team

Kohli had a talented bunch around him – Cheteswar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ishant Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja, KL Rahul. Again, players were discovered outside the traditional centres. Another psychological change was that India no longer worshipped at the altar of orthodoxy. Effectiveness was more important than style. Jasprit Bumrah, who fast-tracked into international cricket, and is possibly India’s greatest fast bowler, might not have made it in earlier generations. He is unorthodox; coaches would have recommended some other profession. The cricket board too finally began to react to regular defeats abroad – India lost all Tests to Australia and England in a six-month span in 2011-12. The golden generation was retiring. Much was made of the ineffectiveness of domestic cricket. The board decided that pitches had to help quick bowlers. It instructed curators to retain 3mm to 8mm grass on pitches. The result over a period was two-fold. India discovered a group of talented fast bowlers while also ensuring the batters could play fast bowling better. You needed fast bowlers to win abroad consistently. The low points of Indian cricket can usually be traced to their weakness against fast bowling. In Manchester in 1952, they were dismissed twice on the same day – for 58 and 82 – as Fred Trueman and Alec Bedser ran through the side. In the ""Summer of 42"" at Lord’s in 1974, they folded for 42 thanks to Geoff Arnold's and Chris Old's dominant bowling. It gave rise to one of the most cruel cartoons in sport, with a woman telling her husband emerging from the toilet, “You should have gone home. Now you have missed the entire Indian innings.”

AFP India's 36 all out in Adelaide 2020 was seen as a freak occurrence, inspiring neither panic nor cartoons

However, India’s dismissal for 36 at Adelaide in 2020 inspired neither cartoons nor panic. That was accepted as a freak innings where every good ball picked a wicket and there were hardly any bad balls. But it required great confidence to pass it off as one of those things – that confidence carried India to victories in two Tests that followed, and with it the series. There was a phase, 2002-2004, when India won Tests at Port of Spain, Leeds, Adelaide, Multan and Rawalpindi. But only in Pakistan did they win the series. Veteran writer David Frith thought India then had the finest Top 6 batting line-up in the history of the game. There was both heft and elegance, a rare combination. But that team did not live up to its potential. This is one of the ironies of Indian cricket - that their most celebrated team did not dominate as they should have. What the current team has is heart. That 36 in Adelaide and 78 in Leeds serve to highlight the temperament of players who can let bygones be bygones and remember only the good times. It is a rare quality in an individual, even rarer in a team. In the past, Indian teams always had a couple of outstanding individuals on whom everything rested. With Sunil Gavaskar dismissed, half the team was gone. If the great spinners were collared, there was no one to turn to until Kapil Dev came along, and if he had a bad day, that was that.

AFP Kolkata's trams have declined from 52 routes in the 1970s to 25 in 2015. Now they run on just three routes

Last week, authorities in the Indian city of Kolkata announced plans to eliminate trams entirely, retaining only a small heritage loop. In response, a group of activists is fighting to ensure that trams remain a vital mode of transport rather than mere nostalgic joyrides. Sandip Roy reports. In February 2023, Kolkata celebrated 150 years of its tramways with music, cake, a beauty parade of vintage trams, including a century-old wooden car, and a cheerful tram conductor, Roberto D’Andrea, who travelled all the way from Melbourne, Australia. Melbourne and Kolkata boast two of the oldest operational tramways in the world. Melbourne’s trams date back to 1885. Kolkata’s first tram, a horse-drawn one, started in 1873. That’s where the similarities end. Melbourne's tram system is going strong despite the government once attempting to get rid of them. The system has been upgraded and some trams are solar-powered. In pictures: India's fading trams Kolkata’s trams have been steadily declining over the years. From 52 routes in the 1970s, down to 25 in 2015 and now to just three. The tram cars rattle and wheeze, having not been updated in years. Even the signs inside have not changed. “Beware of pickpockets”, “No change available for 100 rupees ($1.19; $0.89) or 50” and “To stop the car please ring the bell only once”. Now, the state government has announced that it wants to do away with trams entirely, save for one small loop as a heritage route. But a dogged group of tram activists is fighting back. “It's a huge backward step as cities worldwide are 'decarbonising transport' because of global warming and climate change,” says Mr D’Andrea, who has helped foster a Kolkata-Melbourne tram friendship over the years. “More than 400 cities run tram systems. Cities that dismantled their tramways are rebuilding them at great expense in places like Sydney and Helsinki and all over France. Hong Kong runs trams at high frequency on narrow streets,” he says.

India's oldest trams may soon be brought to a halt

But West Bengal transport minister Snehasis Chakraborty told the media: “The population and vehicular count of Kolkata have multiplied several times but the city’s roads have not widened. Road space continues to hover around 6% which is way less than Mumbai’s 18% and Delhi’s 10%.” Both those cities once had trams. Mumbai had double-decker ones. Both have done away with them, leaving Kolkata as the only Indian city to hold onto the trundling streetcars. In a way they have become emblematic of the city itself. The city has other landmarks - the steel Howrah bridge, the white-domed Victoria Memorial monument, the colonial buildings in the city’s centre. But just as London has its iconic red double-decker buses, Kolkata has its trams. The ding-ding sound of the first tram of the day rattling down streets was the alarm clock many in Kolkata woke up to. They are a familiar sight in films made in the state. “I have used trams in two of my films and the tram depot as well,” says filmmaker Anjan Dutt. Mahanagar (1963), by celebrated filmmaker Satyajit Ray, opens with a stunning two-minute-long tram sequence, sparks flying from the overhead cables before the camera moves inside to settle on the protagonist's tired face as he returns home from work. Here, the tram stands in for the city itself, both its dreams and the daily grind. In fact, Kolkata’s Belgachia tram depot, once bustling with workmen repairing, maintaining, even building trams, nowadays often doubles as a film set. “Even on a working day I saw films being shot in the workshop,” says Subir Bose, a tram company worker who retired in 2022 after 39 years of service. “A Kolkata film means they have to show a tram.”

Getty Images In 1902, Calcutta, as Kolkata was known then, became the first Asian city with electric trams

Trams are very much part of the history of the city and its sense of itself. In 1902, Calcutta as it was known then, became the first Asian city with electric trams. Even after independence, the Calcutta Tramways Company was run from London and was listed on the London Stock Exchange till 1968. The cars were built by companies with names like Burn Standard and Jessop. And it wasn't just a transportation system. The tram lines knit the city together. When bloody Hindu-Muslim riots gripped Calcutta during partition in 1947, tram workers patrolled the city in empty trams to help restore normalcy. “My own father helped save some people from a mob,” says tram driver Gopal Ram. ""Tram workers were like a family. It didn’t matter if you were Hindu or Muslim.” Mr Ram’s great grandfather Antu Ram was a tram employee from the steam-powered days. His grandfather Mahavir and father Jagannath worked for the trams as well. Mr Ram retired recently, the fourth and last generation of his family in Kolkata trams. In some ways, the mystery is that Kolkata’s trams have survived this long. “In the 1950s and 60s, during the personal automobile boom, people were getting rid of trams everywhere, not just in India,” says transport consultant Suvendu Seth. “Now they are making a comeback. The light rail in many cities in the United States is just a newer version of trams. It’s sad that we had it all the time and are neglecting it instead of improving it.” Mr Seth says that instead of complaining about lack of road space, an innovative solution could be to make some roads open only to pedestrians and trams.

AFP Roberto D’Andrea, an Australian tram conductor, travelled to Kolkata last year to celebrate 150 years of its trams

Debashis Bhattacharyya, a retired academic and president of the Calcutta Tram Users Association, thinks trams survived in Kolkata all these years because they connected the city’s schools, hospitals and cinemas. In the 1990s, as the count of cars and buses increased, the then Communist government in the state called trams “obsolete” and wanted to get rid of them. “I protested,” says Mr Bhattacharyya. “If trams went, I felt my whole existence was threatened. I did exhibitions, slide shows, brought in foreign experts. The government should be applying for UNESCO heritage status for trams instead of trying to kill it off. ” Recently, activists have been trying to use culture to save trams. Since 1996, filmmaker Mahadeb Shi has been organising the Tramjatra festival, often in collaboration with Mr D’Andrea. Art students paint the trams and local bands perform in the streetcars. Each Tramjatra has a theme, like Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore’s Gitanjali or the city’s Durga Puja festival. “Tramjatra helped expose younger people to trams too,” says Shi. One north Kolkata tram route was reopened recently. The West Bengal Transport Corporation also tried to make trams cool again with special projects like a tram library, an Independence Day special tram and a short-lived Tram World museum.

Soozana Pvan Sid Sriram is going to perform his biggest solo UK show at the O2 Arena in October

When South Indian star Sid Sriram thinks back to starting out in the music industry, the word ""disrupter"" comes to his mind. His debut in Tamil cinema got a ""lot of pushback"", he says. Indian-born, American-raised Sriram blends a unique Carnatic (South Indian) singing style with soul and R&B influences from his youth. He says Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin and Luther Vandross are big inspirations. People questioned ""what kind of voice is this? Why is he singing like this?"" says Sriram. But he didn’t let the early criticism stop him and has largely let his music do the talking.

This year he became the first South Indian to perform at Coachella, opened for US indie star Bon Iver on his US tour and is about to embark on the UK leg of his All Love No Hate tour. It will be his biggest solo UK show, in front of a crowd at the O2 Arena in London. ""I’ve always had the vision to take our music and elevate it to the highest level,"" Sriram explains to BBC Asian Network's Tamil and South Indian music show.

'A cultural bridge'

A wave of South Asian musicians have been appearing in mainstream spaces and collaborating with western artists. Punjabi megastar Diljit Dosanjh featured on The Tonight Show, AP Dhillon worked with Stormzy and Arijit Singh brought out Ed Sheeran at his concert. Sriram says the success of these artists inspires him to do the same with his Carnatic style. ""My mission since the beginning has been to take my Carnatic musical roots and amplify them across the globe,"" he says. Sriram, who is best known for songs such as Srivalli, Kalaavathi and Neeli Neeli Aakasam, says he felt ""the world wasn't ready"" when he first entered the West. ""Now, over a decade later, it’s clear to me that the world is not only ready for this perspective, but they need it. It’s an exciting time.""

Getty Images Sid Sriram became the first South Indian to perform at Coachella

Describing himself as a ""cultural bridge between two different worlds"", Sriram says being that conduit is what he has ""always wanted to do."" During his Coachella set, Sriram performed a Tamil religious song known as Thiruppugazh which went viral online. ""It was very affirming for me and inspiring for sure,"" he says. He is also signed to label Def Jam, which has artists such as Rihanna, Justin Bieber and Pusha T. Last year he went viral with his critically acclaimed NPR Tiny Desk concert and released Sidharth, an album in English which mixes Carnatic music with R&B and indie rock influences. Sriram says that album has helped open up Tamil music to a new audience. ""Even if I’m doing an English album show I’ll still sing some Tamil film songs and I always get non-South Asian people texting me like: 'Whoa, what was that song?' ""I call myself an ambassador of my language, my culture, my people and if I call myself that then I have to put action to that.""

Getty Images Sriram credits composer AR Rahman for helping give him his break

While Diljit Dosanjh and Arijit Singh cover the globally popular Bollywood and bhangra genres, Sriram is the first Carnatic singer since AR Rahman to do the same. AR Rahman was one of the first South Indian artists to work with mainstream acts, but he did so using Bollywood and film music, most notably with the Oscar-winning soundtrack for Slumdog Millionaire. Sriram contacted AR Rahman after Slumdog Millionaire, which, to his pleasant surprise, gave him his first break. It's a journey he is keen to celebrate in the UK show, where he will play Tamil cinema hits from his debut to now. ""I love performing in the UK because it feels like the audience understands my roots, as well as a lot of the cultural touch points I grew up with in California. ""The resonance is special. ""I came to the UK for the first time last year and it immediately felt like home,"" he says.

But he's not settling. There is ""more to come"" which includes Sriram's own original Tamil music, as opposed to tunes composed by others. ""The next wave is just putting out music in my mother tongue that feels like it’s just pushing the boundary. ""In the way I would if I was making English music and continuing to expand.""",2024-10-06 00:25:44,Entertainment

Amit Saini Atul Kumar studied for hours even during power cuts

Atul Kumar, 18, was ecstatic when he found out in June that he had passed a tough examination that would allow him to join a prestigious technology college in India. But then came the next step: paying 17,500 rupees ($281; £156) online to confirm his admission. It was a big amount for the family from Muzaffarnagar in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. His father managed to borrow the money, but Atul says he missed the online fee deadline by a few seconds, partly due to technical issues. The family didn't give up, filing petitions and court cases. This week, India's top court stepped in and ordered the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Dhanbad, to restore Atul's admission. The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers granted by India's constitution, saying that ""we cannot allow such a young talented boy to go away"". The IITs are India’s top technology institutes, attracting more than a million candidates for nearly 18,000 seats in 23 colleges spread across the country. Students spend years in private coaching centres to prepare for the exams, and parents believe joining an IIT is a ticket to success. Atul's story has made headlines in India because of his financially deprived background and the challenges he overcame.

Atul's parents found it hard to raise the online admission fee

Atul is from the Dalit community, which lies at the bottom of India’s caste hierarchy and is among the most marginalised in the country. His father Rajendra Kumar earns about 450 rupees ($5; £4) a day as a daily wage labourer and his mother weaves cots at home. But Rajendra Kumar says that nothing was more important to him than his children's education. He even sold his house once to fund his eldest son’s studies, he told the BBC. Two of Atul's brothers are studying engineering at reputed colleges, while a third is doing a bachelor's degree from a college in Muzaffarnagar. Atul knew he also had to study hard, and he did that for hours every day in a dark corner of his house which got little sunlight. Erratic electricity supply made things worse, with daily power cuts lasting hours. Rajendra Kumar says buying an inverter didn't make sense as it cost nearly 25,000 rupees. ""But I would have sold the house [again] if needed,"" he adds. Atul had joined a free coaching centre for marginalised students in a nearby city, and this year was his last out of the two attempts allowed in IIT entrance examinations. When Atul passed the exam, his father asked for help from a local moneylender. But the man backed out two hours before the fee deadline. The father then had to turn to his friends, who immediately chipped in with 14,000 rupees. Rajendra Kumar dipped into his savings for the remaining 3,500 rupees. He quickly deposited the amount in his eldest son’s bank account, while Atul logged in to complete the formalities. By then, he had just 180 seconds left for the deadline. “We tried to complete the task that requires many more minutes’ work in three minutes,” Rajendra Kumar said. But the portal froze suddenly, he says, and Atul missed the deadline. In shock, no-one in the family ate for a day.

SWASTIK PAL Kanu was the mastermind of the mass jailbreak, Indian police allege

On a quiet Sunday evening in November 2005, a journalist in India's Bihar state received a panicked phone call at home. “The Maoists have attacked the prison. People are being killed! I’m hiding in the toilet,” an inmate gasped into the mobile phone, his voice trembling. The sound of gunshots echoed in the background. He was calling from a jail in Jehanabad, a poverty-stricken district and, at the time, a stronghold of left-wing extremism. The crumbling, red-brick, colonial-era prison overflowed with inmates. Spread across an acre, its 13 barracks and cells were described in official reports as ""dark, damp, and filthy"". Originally designed for around 230, it held up to 800 prisoners. The Maoist insurgency, which began in Naxalbari, a hamlet in West Bengal state in the late 1960s, had spread to large parts of India, including Bihar. For nearly 60 years, the guerrillas - also called Naxalites - have fought the Indian state to establish a communist society, the movement claiming at least 40,000 lives. The Jehanabad prison was a powder keg, housing Maoists alongside their class enemies - vigilantes from upper caste Hindu private armies. All awaited trial for mutual atrocities. Like many Indian prisons, some inmates had access to mobile phones, secured through bribing the guards. “The place is swarming with rebels. Many are simply walking out,"" the inmate - one of the 659 prisoners at the time - whispered to Mr Singh. On the night of 13 November 2005, 389 prisoners, including many rebels, escaped from Jehanabad prison in what became India's - and possibly Asia's - largest jailbreak. At least two people were killed in the prison shootout, and police rifles were looted amid the chaos. The United States Department of State's 2005 report on terrorism said the rebels had even ""abducted 30 inmates"" who were members of an anti-Maoist group.

PRASHANT RAVI The morning after the Jehanabad jailbreak - the prison has since been demolished

In a tantalising twist, police said the “mastermind” of the jail break was Ajay Kanu, a fiery rebel leader who was among the prisoners. Security was so lax in the decrepit prison that Kanu stayed in contact with his outlawed group on the phone and through messages, helping them come in, police alleged. Kanu says this is not true. Hundreds of rebels wearing police uniforms had crossed a drying stream behind the prison, climbed up and down the tall walls using bamboo ladders and crawled in, opening fire from their rifles. The cells were open as food was being cooked late in the kitchen. The rebels walked to the main gates and opened them. Guards on duty looked on helplessly. Prisoners - only 30 of the escapees were convicts, while the rest were awaiting trial - escaped by simply walking out of the gates, and disappeared into the darkness. It was all over in less than an hour, eyewitnesses said. The mass jail break exposed the crumbling law and order in Bihar and the intensifying Maoist insurgency in one of India’s most impoverished regions. The rebels had timed their plan perfectly: security was stretched thin due to the ongoing state elections.

___ Rajkumar Singh, the local journalist, remembers the night vividly. After getting the phone call, he rode his motorbike through a deserted town, trying to reach his office. He remembers the air was thick with gunshots ringing in the distance. The invading rebels were also trying to attack a neighbouring police station. As he turned onto the main road, dim streetlights revealed a chilling sight - dozens of armed men and women in police uniforms blocking the way, shouting through a megaphone. “We are Maoists,” they declared. “We’re not against the people, only the government. The jailbreak is part of our protest.” The rebels had planted bombs along the road. Some were already detonating, collapsing nearby shops and spreading fear through the town. Mr Singh says he pressed on, reaching his fourth-floor office, where he received a second call from the same prisoner. “Everyone’s running. What should I do?,” the inmate said. “If everyone’s escaping, you should too,” Mr Singh said. Then he rode to the prison through the eerily empty streets. When he reached, he found the gates open. Rice pudding was strewn all over the kitchen, the cell doors were ajar. There was no jailor or policeman in sight. In a room, two wounded policemen lay on the floor. Mr Singh says he also saw the bloodied body of Bade Sharma, the leader of the feared upper caste vigilante army of landlords called Ranvir Sena and a prisoner himself, lying on the floor. The police later said the rebels had shot him while leaving. Lying on the floor and stuck to the walls were blood-stained handwritten pamphlets left behind by the rebels. “Through this symbolic action, we want to warn the state and central governments that if they arrest the revolutionaries and the struggling people and keep them in jail, then we also know how to free them from jail in a Marxist revolutionary way,” one pamphlet said.

PRASHANT RAVI The invading rebels left behind a number of pamphlets when they left the prison

___ A few months ago, I met Kanu, the 57-year-old rebel leader the police accuse of masterminding the jailbreak, in Patna, Bihar’s chaotic capital. At the time of the incident, media reports painted him as ""Bihar’s most wanted"", a figure commanding both fear and respect from the police. Officers recounted how the rebel “commander” instantly took control during the prison break once he was handed an AK-47 by his comrades. In a dramatic turn, the reports said, he “expertly” handled the weapon, swiftly changing magazines before allegedly targeting and shooting Sharma. Fifteen months later, in February 2007, Kanu was arrested from a railway platform while he was travelling from Dhanbad in Bihar to the city of Kolkata. Almost two decades later, Kanu has been acquitted in all but six of the original 45 criminal cases against him. Most of the cases stem from the jailbreak, including that of the murder of Sharma. He has served seven years in prison for one of the cases. Despite his fearsome reputation, Kanu is unexpectedly talkative. He speaks in sharp, measured bursts, downplaying his role in the mass escape that made headlines. Now, this once-feared rebel is subtly shifting his gaze toward a different battle - a career in politics, “fighting for poor, backward castes”. As a child, Kanu spent his days and nights listening to stories from his lower-caste farmer father about Communist uprisings in Russia, China and Indonesia. By eighth grade, his father’s comrades were urging him to embrace revolutionary politics. He says his defiance took root early - after scoring a goal against the local landlord’s son in a football match, armed upper-caste men stormed their home. “I locked myself inside,” he recalls. “They came for me and my sister, ransacking the house, destroying everything. That’s how the upper castes kept us in check - through fear.""

SWASTIK PAL Kanu is eyeing a career in politics, 'fighting for poor, backward castes'

In college, while studying political science, Kanu ironically led the student wing of the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has waged a war against Maoism. After graduation, he co-founded a school, only to be forced out by the owner of the building. Upon returning to his village, tensions with the local landlord escalated. When a local strongman was murdered, Kanu, just 23, was named in the police complaint - and he went into hiding. “Since then I have been on the run, most of my life. I left home early to mobilise workers and farmers, joined and went underground as a Maoist rebel,” he said. He joined the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), a radical communist group. “My profession was liberation - the liberation of the poor. It was about standing up against the atrocities of the upper castes. I fought for those enduring injustice and oppression.” ___ In August 2002, with a feared reputation as a rebel leader and a 3m-rupee ($36,000; £27,000) bounty on his head - an incentive for people to report his whereabouts if they spotted him - Kanu was on his way to meet underground leaders and plan new strategies. He was about to reach his destination in Patna when a car overtook him at a busy intersection. “Within moments, men in plainclothes jumped out, guns drawn, ordering me to surrender. I didn’t resist - I gave up,"" he said.

Father of diamond polishing worker Nikunj Tank says his son took his own life after he lost his job

Nikunj Tank, a worker in the world’s diamond polishing capital Surat in western India, had been desperate since losing his job in May.

The unit he worked at for seven years was facing a financial squeeze and closed down, leaving him and over a dozen others unemployed.

Tank was the family’s sole breadwinner - he was supporting his parents, wife and daughter and had no savings.

‘‘He couldn’t find a job and unable to bear the loss, he took the extreme step,” said his retired father Jayanti Tank.

Tank died by suicide in August.

The last few years have been tough for India’s recession-hit diamond industry. Surat, in Gujarat state, processes 90% of the world’s diamonds in over 5,000 units and employs more than 800,000 polishers. The city has 15 big polishing units with an annual turnover of more than $100m (£75m).

India’s exports of cut and polished stones fell from $23bn in 2022 to $16bn in 2023 and are expected to drop further to $12bn in 2024.

The price of polished diamonds dipped by 5%,s to 27% in 2023, due to lower demand and oversupply, say analysts. Mahesh Virani of Star Gems explained that oversupply occurred because polishing units continued production despite limited demand to keep operations running, ultimately increasing their losses.

The state’s Diamond Workers’ Union, a group representing polishers, told BBC Gujarati that more than 30,000 have lost their jobs in the past six months alone due to the downturn.

The union says that as per their data collected from victims’ families, police records and news reports, 65 workers have died by suicide in the state over one-and-a-half years due to this slowdown. The BBC could not independently verify this figure.

Experts say the Covid-19 lockdown, the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Gaza wars, and falling demand in key markets have adversely impacted India’s diamond industry.

“The business of polished diamonds has gone down by more than 25-30% due to global recession,” said Vallabh Lakhani, chairman of Kiran Gems, a leading manufacturer.

India imports 30% of its rough diamonds from Russian mines – now under Western sanctions due to the war – and cuts and polishes them, then sells them mostly in Western markets.

In March, the European Union and G7 countries imposed a fresh ban on the import of Russian unpolished diamonds, including those processed in India and sold in the West via third countries.",2024-09-30 01:04:21,Business

Getty Images Coldplay is set to perform three shows in Mumbai in January

If you were in India and had 900,000 rupees ($10,800; £8,000), what would you buy? A car? A trip around the world? Diamond jewellery? Or a Coldplay concert ticket? The British rock band is set to perform three shows of their Music of the Spheres world tour in Mumbai next year and the tickets are being sold for obscene amounts on reselling platforms, after being sold out in minutes on BookMyShow (BMS) - the concert's official ticketing platform. The tickets went on sale last Sunday and were priced from 2,500 rupees to 12,000 rupees. More than 10 million people competed to buy some 180,000 tickets. Fans complained about hours-long digital queues and site crashes, but many also alleged that the sales were rigged as resellers had begun selling tickets for five times the price - touching even 900,000 rupees - before they were released on the official site. Earlier this month, something similar happened with tickets for Oasis' concert in the UK, where resellers charged more than £350 for tickets that cost £135. But even then, the inflated prices of Coldplay tickets stand out. To put this in perspective, Madonna charged £1,306.75 for VIP passes to her Celebration tour and the best tickets for Beyoncé's Renaissance concerts sold for £2,400. The events have sparked a conversation around ticket scalping in India, where people use bots or automation tools to bypass queues and purchase multiple tickets to sell on reselling platforms. Fans are questioning whether the official site had taken adequate steps to prevent this, or whether it chose to look the other way. BMS has denied any association with resellers and urged fans to avoid tickets from ""unauthorised sources"" as they could be fake, but this hasn't stopped people from viewing the site suspiciously. Fans have complained about having a similar experience while buying tickets for Punjabi singer Diljit Dosanjh's upcoming concerts. Tickets were released on Zomato Live, the concert promoter, earlier this month and after getting sold out, they began popping up on reselling platforms for several times the original price. Ticket scalping is illegal in India, and experts say that while it's possible that it's happening anyway, it's also likely that legitimate ticket-holders are selling theirs through resellers to make a profit due to the massive demand.

Graphic designer Dwayne Dias was among the few lucky ones who managed to buy tickets for the Coldplay concert from the official site. He bought four tickets for 6,450 rupees each. Since then, he's been approached by people who are willing to pay up to 60,000 rupees for a ticket. ""If I wanted to, I could sell all the tickets and watch the concert in South Korea [Coldplay's upcoming touring destination]. The amount will cover my travel expenses and I'll be able to experience a new city,"" he says. While the inflated prices of Coldplay tickets are shocking, the huge demand for tickets to see popular international artists perform is not uncommon. In fact, the live music business in India has been growing in leaps and bounds over the past couple of years. According to a report, music concerts generated about 8bn rupees in revenue last year and by 2025, this figure is set to increase by 25%. Brian Tellis, a veteran in the music business and one of the founders of the Mahindra Blues music festival, says concerts have become a part of an individual's - and the country's - cultural currency. ⁠Oasis ticket row: How Ticketmaster's owner has grip on UK live music scene

Why do concert tickets now cost as much as a games console? Chart-toppers like Ed Sheeran, Alan Walker and Dua Lipa have performed in India in the recent past, and the latter two are set to perform again this year. ""Like for other industries, India is a booming market for the music business as well. There's a huge demographic that's young and has money to spend. Everyone wants a piece of the pie,"" he says. The soaring demand is evident in ticket prices and sales. Tellis says about a decade ago, 80% of production costs were footed by sponsors and 20% through ticket sales, but the numbers have reversed today. ""Attending a concert is a mix of bragging rights, being a conformist and being part of the scene,"" he says. ""There are true music lovers as well in the mix, but many attend because they get swept up by the hype surrounding a performance and they don't want to feel left out."" Days before and after Coldplay concert tickets went on sale, social media was full of captivating Instagram reels of the band performing hits like Adventure of a Lifetime and Fix You in packed stadiums, with fans singing along and turning the venue into A Sky Full of Stars with their LED bracelets. Influencers waxed eloquent about their love for the band and there was no dearth of Coldplay memes.

BBC Telugu The Tirupati temple in India makes 350,000 laddus every day

India’s most popular sweet - the laddu - is caught in an unsavoury row. The controversy erupted last week when Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu said that lab reports had shown that laddus offered to the deity and then distributed to devotees every day at the famous Tirupati temple in the state were contaminated with animal and vegetable fat. He said the ghee (clarified butter) used in the sweets was adulterated with “beef tallow, fish oil and other impurities”. Temple offerings in India are usually vegetarian. On the face of it, it appeared like a matter of food adulteration - something that authorities in India routinely grapple with. But since Naidu’s announcement, the issue has dominated headlines, caused a major political row and prompted other temples to test their sweets for “purity”.

Getty Images The Tirupati temple attracts millions of devotees from India every year

The Tirupati temple in Andhra Pradesh is one of Hinduism’s most sacred shrines. Dedicated to Hindu god Sri Venkateswara - popularly known as Balaji – the temple owns assets worth tens of billions of dollars and attracts nearly 24 million devotees from India and abroad every year. The famous Tirupati laddus - made with gram flour, sugar, cashews, raisins and cardamom and cooked in “pure cow ghee” – are prized by devotees who consider them god’s blessing and carry them back home to share with family and friends. Reports say more than 350,000 laddus are prepared daily in the temple’s kitchen. So Naidu’s revelations have been met with dismay, with many religious leaders calling on authorities to protect the sanctity of temples. “Care should be taken that such great sins are not repeated in a temple that has tens of millions of devotees,” Ramana Deekshitulu, a priest, told news agency ANI. Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati, another prominent priest, called it “an attack on the faith and belief of tens of millions of Hindus”. “This is an organised crime and a huge betrayal of Hindus. It should be investigated and strict action should be taken against the guilty,” he told a news channel. The issue has also turned into a political slugfest after Naidu blamed his rival and former chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy for the ""desecration"".

BBC Telugu Laddus being made in the Tirupati temple kitchen

Naidu, who was sworn in as the state’s chief minister in June, alleged that the impure laddus were distributed to devotees during Reddy’s term. The temple board is run by the state government, which appoints its chief. Naidu said he had changed the ghee supplier and formed a special investigation team led by a senior police officer to address the issue. An angry Reddy has rejected the allegations and accused Naidu of playing politics. In a strongly-worded letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he asked him to “severely reprimand” Naidu, who’s a key ally in Modi’s federal government. “Naidu is a pathological and habitual liar” who was tarnishing the image of the temple trust with false campaigns, he wrote. Reddy said even though the temple did not have a lab to check the ghee’s purity, its officials were experienced in identifying impurities by appearance and smell and that there had been instances - both during his government and also earlier when Naidu’s party had been in power - when ghee tankers were sent back to suppliers. Reddy's party has also invited people to take part in religious rituals in temples across the state to ""atone for the sin"" that, they say, Naidu has committed by making allegations about the laddus.

TTD A Tirupati priest sprinkled holy water on trays of laddus as part of a purification ritual

Meanwhile, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) – the board that manages the nearly 2,000-year-old temple - has been trying to do damage control. A board spokesperson told reporters that they were sourcing ghee from five companies via tenders. After complaints from pilgrims and laddu makers, they sent samples for lab tests which revealed that four tankers from AR Dairy in Tamil Nadu were of substandard quality. In response, AR Dairy, which has been producing ghee since 1998 and claims to conduct 102 quality checks on its milk, dismissed the allegations as “absurd” and stated that they are “severely damaging to our business.” It said a quality control officer at the firm had called the allegations that fish oil was added “nonsensical”, as fish oil costs more than ghee, and that “any form of adulteration would be immediately noticeable by its odour”. The temple, meanwhile, said it had done its own penance. To assure devotees that its laddus were now rid of defects and fit for gods and humans, the priests held a four-hour-long “purification ritual” on Monday. Photographs released by the temple board showed priests sprinkling holy water in the kitchen, on sacks of ingredients and on huge trays of laddus.

Faisal Bashir Sheikh Abdul Rashid is drawing crowds at his election rallies in Kashmir

Sheikh Abdul Rashid, who had been in jail since Article 370 was abrogated in 2019, was granted interim bail earlier this month on terror funding charges he denies. The 57-year-old, who is popularly known as Engineer Rashid, has urged people to vote for his candidates instead of regional or national parties. His Awami Ittehad Party has fielded candidates in more than three dozen seats. The high-stakes assembly elections are the first since the region's autonomy was revoked in 2019. With 873 candidates across 90 constituencies in the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley and Hindu-majority Jammu, the elections have been described by federal officials as a proof of normalcy in a region long plagued by insurgency. The third and last phase of the polls will be held on Tuesday and votes will be counted on 8 October. Kashmir's politics, dominated by mainstream parties pledging allegiance to India, has had a history of individuals and groups seeking separation from the country or enhanced autonomy for Kashmir, with some of them supporting an armed movement to achieve that. Article 370: What happened with Kashmir and why it matters

Kashmir: The complicated truth behind its 'normality' Some separatist groups in the past have also backed Pakistan's role in Kashmir. India and Pakistan both claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it. But this assembly election has seen participation of many former separatist leaders as well. Rashid has chosen to be part of the democratic process but has been vocal against what he calls Delhi's ""heavy-handed"" rule in Kashmir. He is known for his fiery speeches, and leading protests in unconventional ways against alleged government excesses, often irking authorities. He made waves in June when he defeated regional political heavyweight Omar Abdullah in parliamentary elections. While he was lodged in jail, his sons led an emotionally charged and successful campaign on his behalf. But this time he is able to speak to voters directly and he has also smartly used social media to amplify his messages.

Faisal Bashir Supporters of Rashid at an election rally in Baramulla

Within hours of being released on 11 September, Rashid told the media that he was going to fight against the removal of Article 370. The article allowed the state its own constitution, a separate flag and freedom to make laws. Foreign affairs, defence and communications remained the preserve of the federal government. ""We don’t accept Prime Minister [Narendra Modi's] decision taken on 5 August [2019],” he said, referring to the day when the autonomy was abrogated. He then went live on Facebook, repeating similar messages. The hour-long speech currently has more than 2.5m views, 44,000 likes and 25,000 comments – an unusually high number for a regional politician. Rashid’s popularity worries his regional opponents, who have termed him a “proxy” of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Two former chief ministers of the state and the heirs of leading regional parties, Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah, have publicly questioned his party’s funding and alleged that he was dividing voters to favour the BJP. He has repeatedly denied the allegations. ""If I were a BJP man, I wouldn’t have spent over five years in jail,” he told the BBC. ""I won [almost] 500,000 votes in the general elections, how could I be dividing votes?"". Prof Sheikh Showkat Hussain, a political analyst, said Rashid's release from jail just days before the elections did give his opponents a pretext to accuse him of collusion with the BJP-run federal government in Delhi. “Despite these allegations, his win in the 2024 parliamentary elections from jail has given him an unprecedented credibility in the eyes of the locals,” he said. Rashid has also worked hard to carefully craft his image. Unlike the valley’s prominent leaders who have established political lineages, Rashid has managed to establish an image of a “common man’s politician” who doesn’t shy away from taking on authorities. In 2012, he attempted to bring dozens of dogs into the state secretariat as a protest against the government's inaction on the growing canine menace in his constituency, where numerous dog bite incidents had been reported. ""I hope the ministers and bureaucracy now understand the seriousness of the issue,"" he said at the time. But Rashid’s bluntness and candour have also landed him in trouble. In 2015, he hosted a “beef party” to protest a ban on the slaughter of cows, considered sacred by many Hindus, in several states. A day later, members of the BJP, then a part of the state’s ruling coalition, assaulted him in the assembly. A few days later, members of a Hindu group outraged by the ""beef party"" attacked him at Delhi’s Press Club, dousing his face with ink as he protested the lynching of a Kashmiri truck driver accused of cow smuggling in Jammu.

The tragic death of a 26-year-old Indian employee at a leading accounting firm has ignited a serious debate about workplace culture and employee welfare in corporate environments.

Anna Sebastian Perayil, a chartered accountant at Ernst & Young (EY), died in July, four months after joining the firm. Her parents have alleged that the ""overwhelming work pressure"" at her new job took a toll on her health and led to her death.

EY has refuted the allegation, saying that Perayil was allotted work like any other employee and that it didn't believe that work pressure could have claimed her life.

Her death has resonated deeply, sparking a discussion on the ""hustle culture"" promoted by many corporates and start-ups - a work ethic that prioritises productivity, often at the expense of employee well-being.

Some argue that this culture drives innovation and growth, with many choosing extra hours out of passion or ambition. Others say that employees are often pressured by management, leading to burnout and a diminished quality of life.

Perayil's death came under the spotlight after a letter written by her mother Anita Augustine to EY went viral on social media last week. In the letter, she detailed the alleged pressures her daughter had experienced at work, including working late into the night and on weekends, and appealed to EY to ""reflect on its work culture"" and take steps to prioritise its employees' health.

""Anna's experience sheds light on a work culture that seems to glorify overwork while neglecting the very human beings behind the roles,"" she wrote. ""The relentless demands and the pressure to meet unrealistic expectations are not sustainable, and they cost us the life of a young woman with so much potential.""

Many people condemned EY for its ""toxic work culture"", sharing their experiences on Twitter and LinkedIn. One user alleged that he had been made to work for 20 hours a day at a top consultancy firm without being paid overtime.

""Work culture in India is horrid. Pay is dismal, exploitation is max [maximum]. There are zero repercussions and no remorse on the part of employers who routinely harass workers,"" another user wrote, adding that managers are often praised for overworking and underpaying their employees.

A former EY employee criticised the work culture at the firm and alleged that employees were often ""mocked"" for leaving on time and ""shamed"" for enjoying weekends.

""Interns [are] given crazy workload, unrealistic timelines and [are] humiliated during reviews as it builds character for their future,"" he wrote.",2024-09-24 21:39:31,Politics

Vishal Jaiswal Vishal Jaiswal turned a childhood hobby into a profession

Vishal Jaiswal has been flying drones since he was young. Now 27, that childhood hobby has become his profession. A recent project involved mapping part of the Sundarbans, a vast area of mangrove forests where the waters of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers spill into the Bay of Bengal. Covering more than 4,000 sq miles (10,360 sq km) of coastal India and Bangladesh, it is the world's biggest area of mangroves. ""It’s a very dense area with mix of everything, including forests with wild animals,"" says Mr Jaiswal. Along with two other team members he mapped 150 sq km in three days. “A trained and skilled person is needed to fly a drone in thick mangroves area,"" he says. ""It was a difficult task. We mapped the area from deep inside the forest, travelling there on boats and roads.” It was one of many projects aimed at protecting the mangrove forest from the effects of climate change and human activities. Globally, more than half of all mangrove ecosystems are at risk of collapse by 2050, according to a recent report from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). ""Mangroves are threatened by deforestation, development, pollution, and dam construction, but the risk to these ecosystems is increasing due to sea-level rise and the increased frequency of severe storms associated with climate change,"" the report said. In India the picture is mixed. The mangroves of South India, Sri Lanka and Maldives are ""critically endangered,"" according to the IUCN report.

Other Indian mangroves are not on that ""red list"". The Sundarbans are one of those mangroves not considered endangered by the (IUCN). However, Dr Sahadev Sharma, a consultant scientist to the USDA Forestry Service, says there are signs of both manmade and natural stress, which he identified during his field survey beginning of this year. ""We are seeing a loss in dense mangrove cover in Sundarbans. Additionally, patches on the western coast are extremely fragmented and eroded due to shrimp farming and development,"" he says. But it's hard for scientists to know exactly what's happening to the Sundarbans. There's a lack of field research, partly because it's a difficult place to work. ""It requires coordination with officers and ground staff, procuring field supplies in remote areas, and planning extensive logistics for field operations. ""The risk of saltwater crocodiles and Bengal tigers, tides and treacherous terrain make the field work even more difficult,"" he says. So, scientists are turning to tech, like Mr Jaiswal's drones, to monitor the mangroves. One key bit of information needed is the height of the mangroves in relation to the sea level. The rivers flooding into the Sundarbans dump sediment, raising the ground level. But if the sea level rises faster than that soil building process, then the mangroves will be threatened. This process is monitored by installing rSETs (rod surface elevation tables) across mangrove forests.

Sahadev Sharma Sahadev Sharma (holding drill) has been installing monitoring posts in the Sundarbans

The first part of the process is to drive steel rods into the mud, to provide a base for the measuring equipment. Then Lidar scanners are attached to the top of the rods. These use lasers to scan the ground up to 2m away from the central rod, taking hundreds of thousands of extremely accurate measurements. It's a big improvement on the previous system, which involved attaching cumbersome fibreglass arms to the rods, which were extended to take height measurements. That method would take hours to produce just 36 measurements and relied on the user placing the arms in the exact same positions as previous surveys. ""Because we are using a laser, there is minimal human error and the precision of this method is much greater than the traditional pin methods,"" says Mr Sharma. But it has one drawback - it's more expensive than the old way. Nevertheless, the project is making progress with the help of local partners. Measuring sites are in place in the Andaman Islands, Sundarbans and Coringa and there are plans to install more in Bhitarkanika National Park, Orissa. The research is still in its early days, they have a few data sets, but are waiting for the water level to recede before they can start measuring in the Sundarbans.

Getty Images Singer Diljit Dosanjh will be bringing his Punjabi style to the UK

""Punjabi Aa Gaye Oye (The Punjabis have arrived)"". There's only one way to start a show if you're Diljit Dosanjh. The trailblazing Punjabi artist has had a dizzying rise over the past few years. He's been heard across the world thanks to collaborations with Western acts including Sia, Ed Sheeran and rapper Saweetie. And he cemented his megastar status by becoming the first Punjabi-language singer to perform at US music festival Coachella, following that with an appearance on Jimmy Fallon's The Tonight Show. But, as the traditional greeting he uses at the start of each show suggests, wherever he goes in the world, he always brings Punjab with him. And fans, collaborators and friends say that's part of the secret to his appeal.

Punjabi power

""He’s shown how important it is to keep in touch with your culture,"" says Khushi Kaur, a British Punjabi vocalist. ""And in an empowering way, as an artist who is growing,"" Khushi, 20, tells BBC Newsbeat. Khushi, from Nottingham, considers Diljit her main role model and feels his commitment to Punjabi culture explains some of the success. ""He has worked with Western artists, but maintained that cultural aspect,"" she says. ""And that is so important because when us as the younger generation look at that, and see what he's done... it says to us we can be a part of that. ""In our music or the way we dress, it makes us look up and say ‘we can make it’."" The Rise of Diljit Dosanjh: An Asian Network special on BBC Sounds

@Casa.Lente Like her idol Diljit, Khushi started off doing kirtans (devotional songs)

During his appearance on The Tonight Show, Diljit performed in his native language and dressed in traditional Punjabi attire, with a bhangra-filled performance. One of the songs he performed was G.O.A.T., a track he worked on with British-Asian producer G-Funk. He says Diljit's appeal comes from a sense of mystery and curiosity, and doesn't believe Western audiences would pay as much attention if he sang in English. ""People who are not Punjabi are wondering what he’s saying and what the big fuss is,"" he says. ""That’s helped him."" G-Funk says Diljit also resonates with audiences who share his Punjabi heritage by sticking to his traditions and native language. He says he messaged the star after his Tonight Show appearance: ""Thank you for putting our people on the map."" ""To be representing our people, not shying away from our culture is a big thing,"" he says.

US rapper Saweetie told Podcrushed that Diljit was a ""respectful and humble"" collaborator, and it's something G-Funk says he's experienced while working with him for a number of years. Despite being a successful musician, actor and film producer, G-Funk says the singer is a ""normal and down to earth guy"", and one of their first meetings took place over dinner at Nando's. ""He will address people as ‘Paaji’ [elder brother] even though I’m much younger than him and I haven’t done anything on his level,"" says G-Funk. He is also quick to respond to those lucky enough to have his number. ""He loves his voicenotes and there’s two emojis he likes using. ""Prayer hands and the really smiley face that goes up to your eyes."" Up-and-coming artist Khushi says staying clear of controversty and the model of modesty Diljit portrays is an inspiration for a young artist like her. ""He has maintained his morals, his ethics and he's remained humble which is amazing to see. ""I think that's one thing I definitely keep that no matter how much I do,"" she says.

Taniya Happy Diljit fan Taniya loves the ""pure Punjabi"" vibe that Diljit brings

But it's not just in the music industry itself where Diljit's impact has been felt. Siblings Vaibhav and Taniya Happy, who were born in Punjab and grew up listening to Diljit’s early music, say he gives them a slice of home. Now living in Glasgow, they tell Newsbeat they are ""proud"" of his journey. ""When he performed at Coachella, that was a proud moment for Punjabis,"" says Vaibhav, 20. ""It feels like he's doing it for us. He was wearing cultural clothes and enjoying himself as a Punjabi, not changing his appearance for other people."" Taniya, 25, says Diljit has a vibe which is unmatched. ""When you grow up, you can lose a part of your culture as you start adapting to new cultures,"" she says. She feels in an English-speaking country like the UK, ""it’s hard for people to speak Punjabi unless they are in their own household"". ""So it’s nice to see people out there singing Diljit, because he sings in Punjabi, and then it feels like your own place. ""It doesn’t feel like you’re in a foreign country,"" she says.

Vaibhav Happy Vaibhav ""loves the passion Diljit has for the culture of Punjab""

Taniya and Vaibhav will be among the thousands watching Diljit perform hits like Lover, Vibe and Lak 28 Kudi Da. For Vaibhav, it will be his first time seeing him and he says he is ""gassed"". ""And I’m going with my family – sister and mum – which makes it even better. ""I grew up listening to him, with my parents and at events.

Getty Images Bollywood's Amitabh Bachchan has not commented on the report and Tamil superstar Rajinikath said he was not aware of it

A recent report, which details poor working conditions and rampant sexual harassment faced by women in Malayalam-language cinema, is causing seismic upheavals in the entertainment industry in India. But the messages of solidarity and support have come largely from women - and critics say the silence of powerful men, including India's biggest and most loved stars, is deafening. Based on testimonies from 51 people from the Kerala-based film industry, the Hema Committee report lays bare decades of exploitation and says that “women have been asked to make themselves available for sex on demand” and that they were constantly told to make “compromise and adjustments” if they wanted work. The panel was set up in 2017 after Women in Cinema Collective (WCC), formed by a group of women working in the Malayalam cinema, petitioned the government after a top actress was sexually assaulted by a group of men allegedly at the behest of a top male actor. Their 290-page report was released last month, with chunks redacted to hide the identities of the survivors and those accused of harassment. But since its release on 19 August, several women have publicly spoken up about their ordeal and more than a dozen police complaints have been lodged against male stars, producers, directors and other influential men. The state government has set up a special investigation team (SIT) to look into the allegations and the Kerala high court has asked the SIT to investigate the instances mentioned in the report, raising hopes that the survivors may after all get justice.

Getty Images The Malayalam industry is known for making both popular and critically acclaimed films

Women in all Indian film industries, including in the biggest and hugely popular Bollywood, have repeatedly spoken about the casting couch – the practice of men asking for sexual favours in return for roles – and rampant sexual harassment they face. “The rot is as deep as the ocean across all Indian film industries,” film critic and author Shubhra Gupta told the BBC. “We won’t find a single female performer anywhere in the country who has not suffered. If everyone came out to complain, it will take us many decades to deal with all those complaints.” The sordid revelations about the extent of the rot in Malayalam cinema have made headlines and the findings have been debated on primetime TV. Deedi Damodaran, a WCC member, told the BBC that the response has been “overwhelming”. “Some women have now talked about how they had to flee the industry because of the terrible things that happened to them. They have no evidence, but they’ve got some sort of closure by talking about their experiences.” Many of them, she says, have spoken out despite being trolled and abused on social media.

The report has also created ripples in other film industries, with calls for reform being heard in regional industries based in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka. In Telangana, pressure has grown on the government to publish a report on the Telugu film industry that’s been waiting to see the light of the day for two years. An inquiry was instituted after an upcoming actress, Sri Reddy, protested by stripping down to her undergarments in public in 2018 “to draw attention to the sexual exploitation of women in the industry”. West Bengal has set up a committee to investigate allegations of sexual abuse in the Bengali film industry, actress Ritabhari Chakraborty has said. This, she added, would “cleanse the industry from predators”. A report that exposed the Kerala film industry Women in Tamil and Kannada cinema have also petitioned their state governments to improve working conditions for them. Veteran Tamil actress Radhika Sarathkumar told the BBC that the Hema committee report has created a lot of awareness and that “men will be scared now”. “It's time women in cinema get together and speak up and stop this nonsense,” she said. But the lack of support from the men in the industry, says Damodaran, has been disappointing. Malayalam superstars Mohanlal and Mammootty have welcomed the report but said that nothing should be done to hurt the industry. “These heroes are worshipped as larger than life beings, but we’re waiting for them to take a heroic stand,” Damodaran told the BBC.

In Tamil Nadu, actor-politicians Kamal Haasan and Vijay's silence has been noted, while Rajinikanth faced criticism for claiming ignorance of the report 10 days after its release. “The harassment happens to each of us, how come men don’t know about it? Maybe the male actors compartmentalise, maybe they choose not to see it,” Sarathkumar told the BBC. “It's very sad that every time the onus in on the women to protect themselves.” Some have also pointed out that the biggest names in Bollywood - Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan and Akshay Kumar - have chosen to remain silent. Gupta says their silence may be deafening, but it’s not unexpected. “I would’ve been very surprised if there had been a reaction. We saw what happened in 2018 after the #MeToo movement first started in Bollywood after actress Tanushree Dutta accused an actor of behaving inappropriately towards her on a film set in 2008."" ""For a while, there was a groundswell of support and it seemed that Bollywood would step up and do something about it. But then things were contained. None of the men suffered any consequences, they are all back to doing what they did. In fact, the women who complained didn’t get work.”

More than 70,000 people fighting in Russia’s military have now died in Ukraine, according to data analysed by the BBC. And for the first time, volunteers - civilians who joined the armed forces after the start of the war - now make up the highest number of people killed on the battlefield since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in 2022. Every day, the names of those killed in Ukraine, their obituaries and photographs from their funerals are published across Russia in the media and on social networks. BBC Russian and the independent website Mediazona have collated these names, along with names from other open sources, including official reports.

We checked that the information had been shared by authorities or relatives of the deceased - and that they had been identified as dying in the war. New graves in cemeteries have also helped provide the names of soldiers killed in Ukraine - these are usually marked by flags and wreaths sent by the defence ministry. We have identified the names of 70,112 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine, but the actual number is believed to be considerably higher. Some families do not share details of their relatives’ deaths publicly - and our analysis does not include names we were unable to check, or the deaths of militia in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.

Among them, 13,781 were volunteers - about 20% - and fatalities among volunteers now exceed other categories. Former prisoners, who joined up in return for pardons for their crimes, were previously the highest but they now account for 19% of all confirmed deaths. Mobilised soldiers - citizens called up to fight - account for 13%. Since October last year, weekly fatalities of volunteers have not dipped below 100 - and, in some weeks, we have recorded more than 310 volunteer deaths. As for Ukraine - it rarely comments on the scale of its deaths on the battlefield. In February, its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed, but estimates based on US intelligence suggest greater losses. The story of Rinat Khusniyarov is typical of many of the volunteer soldiers who died. He was from Ufa in Bashkortostan and had been working two jobs to make ends meet - at a tram depot and a plywood factory. He was 62 years old when he signed his contract with the Russian army in November last year. He survived less than three months of fighting and was killed on 27 February. His obituary, in a local online memorial website, simply called him “a hardworking, decent man”.

Rinat Khusniyarov via ok.ru Rinat Khusniyarov signed up to fight at the age of 62

According to the data we analysed, most of the men signing up come from small towns in parts of Russia where stable, well-paid work is hard to find. Most appear to have joined up willingly, although some in the republic of Chechnya have told human rights activists and lawyers of coercion and threats. Some of the volunteers have said they did not understand the contracts they were signing had no end date, and have since approached pro-Kremlin journalists to, unsuccessfully, ask them for help ending their service. Salaries in the military can be five to seven times higher than average wages in less affluent parts of the country, plus soldiers get social benefits, including free childcare and tax breaks. One-off payments for people who sign up have also repeatedly risen in value in many parts of Russia. Most of the volunteers dying at the front are aged between 42 and 50. They number 4,100 men in our list of more than 13,000 volunteers. The oldest volunteer killed was 71 years old - a total of 250 volunteers above the age of 60 have died in the war. Soldiers have told the BBC that rising casualties among volunteers are, in part, down to their deployment to the most operationally challenging areas on the front line, notably in the Donetsk region in the east, where they form the backbone of reinforcements for depleted units, Russian soldiers told the BBC. Russia’s “meat grinder” strategy continues unabated, according to Russian soldiers we have spoken to. The term has been used to describe the way Moscow sends waves of soldiers forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery. Drone footage shared online shows Russian forces attacking Ukrainian positions with little or no equipment or support from artillery or military vehicles.

Sometimes, hundreds of men have been killed on a single day. In recent weeks, the Russian military have made desperate, but unsuccessful, attempts to seize the eastern Ukrainian towns of Chasiv Yar and Pokrovsk with such tactics. An official study by the primary military medical directorate of the Russian defence ministry says that 39% of soldiers’ deaths are a result of limb injuries and that mortality rates would be significantly improved if first aid and subsequent medical care were better. The Russian government’s actions suggests it is keen to avoid forcing people to fight through a new, official wave of mobilisation - instead, it is ramping up calls for service volunteers, along with the incentives to do so. Remarks by regional officials in local parliaments suggest they have been tasked from the top with trying to recruit people from their local districts. They advertise on job vacancy websites, contact men who have debt and bailiff problems, and conduct recruitment campaigns in higher education establishments. Since 2022, convicted prisoners have also been encouraged to join up in return for their release, but now a new policy means people facing criminal prosecution can accept a deal to go to war instead of facing trial in court. In return, their cases are frozen and potentially dropped altogether.

125,Why hundreds of Samsung workers are protesting in India,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7488w85n00o,"Why hundreds of Samsung workers are protesting in India

Reuters More than a thousand workers are participating in the strike

For the past 11 days, about 1,500 workers of South Korean technology giant Samsung Electronics have been striking work in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, leading to major disruptions in production. The plant in Chennai city, one of Samsung's two factories in India, employs nearly 2,000 workers and produces home appliances, contributing about a third to the company's annual $12bn (£9bn) revenue in India. The striking workers gather at a plot of land near the 17-year-old factory daily, demanding that Samsung recognise their newly-formed labour union - the Samsung India Labour Welfare Union (SILWU). They say that only a union can help them negotiate better wages and working hours with the management. The protest, one of the largest Samsung has seen in recent years, comes even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been courting foreign investment by positioning India as a viable alternative to China for manufacturing activities. Samsung India has released a statement saying that the welfare of its workers was its top priority. ""We have initiated discussions with our workers at the Chennai plant to resolve all issues at the earliest,” it said. Hours earlier, the police had detained around 104 workers for undertaking a protest march without permission. The protesters were released in the evening. ""The workers have decided to strike work indefinitely till their demands are met,” said A Soundararajan, member of Centre of Indian Trade Unions (Citu), backed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Citu has backed the new union in the factory. The workers have three key demands: Samsung must recognise the new union, allow collective bargaining, and reject competing unions as about 90% of the workforce belongs to SILWU, said Mr Soundararajan.

Reuters The Chennai plant contributes about $4bn to Samsung's annual $12bn India revenue

Workers, earning an average of 25,000 rupees ($298; £226) a month, are demanding staggered raises totalling a 50% increase over the next three years, according to Citu. Citu also alleged that workers at the plant were being ""pressurised to finish each product - like a refrigerator, washing machine, or TV - within 10-15 seconds"", work non-stop for four to five hours at a stretch, and do their jobs in unsafe conditions. “We categorically deny that workers are made to work for four hours at a stretch. All workers get suitable breaks in between,"" Samsung India said in an official statement. ""Also, employees work on their given task of the manufacturing process as products are passed through the conveyor line. They are not required to 'finish' a product in such a time frame, which is not realistic. We reiterate that we are in compliance with all laws and regulations,"" the statement added. Mr Soundararajan also alleged that workers were pressurised by the management to leave the new union and that their families were threatened as well. Samsung India said the firm ""categorically denies all the allegations and that it maintains absolute compliance with all the existing labour laws"". Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu's Labour Welfare Minister CV Ganesan said he had assured union officials that talks were under way to resolve their issues. ""We will fulfil the demands of the workers,"" he said. Sijo*, a protester, said that he arrives at the protest site daily at 08:00 IST (02:30 GMT) and stays until 17:00, joining hundreds of workers in their blue Samsung India uniforms. The union arranges for lunch and water for the protesters, while a makeshift cloth tent protects them from the elements. There are no washroom facilities, so the workers use the outdoors. ""Since the factory was set up, employees have been working without complaints or a union. But things have been getting bad over the past couple of years, and now, we need the support of a union,"" Sijo said. He added that his pay doesn't keep pace with the cost of living and that this has put a strain of his family's finances. Up until 2020, the Samsung Group was known for not allowing unions to represent its workers. But things changed after the company came under intense public scrutiny after its chairman was prosecuted for market manipulation and bribery.

BBC A group of discharged men near the Russia-Ukraine border on their way out

Last week, the Indian government announced that Russia had discharged dozens of the 91 Indians who were duped into fighting for Russian forces in the country's war with Ukraine. Several of them have since returned home, while the process to bring others back is under way. The BBC's Neyaz Farooquee spoke to some of the men about their struggles. “I am in panic. I am not sure if I will return safely or in a box. Please save me.” This is the message Urgen Tamang, a former Indian soldier, sent to the BBC from outside a southern Ukrainian city, a few days before he was discharged from the frontlines in Russia’s war against Ukraine, which entered its third year this February. Mr Tamang is among the 91 Indians who were forced into fighting in the war. Most of them are from poor families and were lured by agents with the promise of money and jobs, sometimes as ""helpers"" in the Russian army. Instead, they were sent to the war zone. Many of them said they were stationed in parts of Ukraine under Russian control, where they had to navigate landmines, drones, missiles and sniper attacks with little to no military training. Nine Indians have died in the conflict so far and Indian authorities say they have arrested 19 people for human trafficking. In July, Russia promised an early release of all Indians fighting in its army, following a visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Moscow, during which he raised the issue with President Vladimir Putin. The two countries have traditionally shared a warm relationship. Forty-five of them have been discharged since then. Some have safely returned home, while others like Mr Tamang are on their way.

""I can't believe I am out of there,"" said Sunil Karwa, an electrician from Rajasthan who joined the Russian army in February. Posted near Bakhmut, an eastern Ukraine city that has seen intense fighting, he was at the Moscow airport waiting to board his flight when he spoke to the BBC. Mr Karwa described scenes of deaths and destruction, a reality which hit him the hardest when a man from his neighbouring village was shot on the battlefield. “They sent him back on the frontline 15 days after the injury and he fainted in the field. He is paralysed now,” he said. Like him, most of the other recruits were also blue-collar workers aged between 19 and 35, who were hired by agents based in India, Dubai and Russia.

Ukraine war: Indians ‘duped’ by agents into fighting for Russia They say their contracts were in Russian, a language they didn't understand. Yet they signed it in the hope of getting better opportunities. ""The process was so quick - just a few signatures and photos and we were in [the army],"" Mr Karwa said. Raja Pathan joined the army as a last resort in February, after an education consultant deceived him into enrolling in a non-existent college. “When I got there, I saw banners advertising recruitments for the army. By then, I had spent so much time and money that I decided to join anyway,” he said. It was the death of two friends, which eventually pushed Mr Pathan to leave. He was released in August with the help of a sympathetic Russian commander who facilitated his exit. Now based in Moscow, he helps other Indians escape from there.

Mohammad Sufyan from the southern state of Telangana returned to India on 12 September with five other men. Safe in his home, he carries the trauma of surviving on the frontline. ""There was little rest there and in the beginning, I couldn't speak to my family for 25 days,"" he said. The most scarring moment came in February when his friend Hemil Mangukiya - an Indian man from Gujarat state - was killed right before his eyes. “He was merely 15 metres from me, digging a trench near Krynky [in Kherson], when a missile landed,” recalled Mr Sufyan. “I put his dead body in the truck with my own hands.” “After seeing the dead body of my friend, I didn’t have the strength for anything,"" he added. After the death, Mr Sufyan and other Indians stuck there released a video pleading for help, which reached Indian MP Asaduddin Owaisi, who raised the matter with the foreign ministry. Families of the men had also appealed to the Indian government for help in bringing them back.

From a distance, army personnel in bulletproof jackets, armed with automatic rifles, stand watch, tracking every movement. For the first time in a decade, elections are being held in 47 assembly seats of Kashmir, long marked by violence and unrest. The region, claimed by both India and Pakistan, has been the cause of three wars between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Since the 1990s, an armed insurgency against Indian rule has claimed thousands of lives, including civilians and security forces. The three-phase polls will also extend to the 43 seats in the neighbouring Hindu-majority Jammu region. The election is the first since 2019, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked Jammu and Kashmir's autonomy, stripped its statehood, and split it into two federally-administered territories. Since then, the region has been governed by a federal administrator. Article 370: What happened with Kashmir and why it matters In the fray are 13 main parties vying for a majority in the 90-seat assembly. The major players are the two main regional parties - the PDP led by Mehbooba Mufti and the National Conference (NC) which is headed by Omar Abdullah. Both Mufti and Abdullah are former chief ministers of the region. The NC has formed an alliance with India's main opposition party Congress. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is also contesting but not many are betting on the party, which has a stronghold in Jammu but a weak political base in the valley. In the last elections in 2014, the BJP had formed a government in alliance with PDP after sweeping Jammu. The alliance fell apart in 2018 after years of disagreements. Also in the picture, this time, is Engineer Rashid - a controversial politician who has spent five years in jail accused in a terror case and was released on bail this week. Rashid came to limelight earlier this year when he pulled off a stunning victory in the general election over Abdullah. He fought the election from jail, with his sons leading an emotional campaign on the ground.

Elections in Kashmir have long been contentious, with residents and separatist leaders often boycotting them, viewing the process as Delhi's attempt to legitimise its control. Since 1947, Kashmir has held 12 assembly elections, but voter turnout has often been low and marked by violence. Militants have attacked polling stations, and security forces have been accused of forcing voters to come out and vote. Since the 1990s, hundreds of political workers have been kidnapped or killed by militant groups. But for the first time in decades, even separatist leaders are contesting in several seats. The most keenly watched of these is the outlawed Jamaat-e-Islami (JEI) party, which has joined hands with Rashid's Awami Ittehad Party (AIP). Residents will vote to elect a local assembly, led by a chief minister and council of ministers. Though the assembly will have limited powers under Delhi's rule, it has sparked hopes for a political change in the valley. Almost all opposition parties have pledged to restore statehood and the region's special status. The BJP has ruled out restoring autonomy but has promised to reinstate statehood to Jammu and Kashmir ""at an appropriate time after the elections"". Most residents appeared to be reconciled to the loss of their region's autonomy. “I don’t think Article 370 will come back unless any miracle happens,” said Suheel Mir, a research scholar, adding that parties were making promises about restoring autonomy in a “politically charged” atmosphere to get votes. Several young men and women said they were more concerned about issues like political instability, corruption and most of all, unemployment - also a major concern in Jammu. “We want to cast our vote to resolve our day-to-day issues. It has nothing to do with the Kashmir dispute,” said a man who did not wish to be named.

But others said they didn't want to give the impression that they had accepted the events of 2019 and would participate in the election solely to vote against the BJP. ""We want to send a message to the government that the revocation is unacceptable to us no matter what,"" said 38-year-old Zameer Ahmad. Five years ago when Modi's government abrogated Article 370, the 70-year-old constitutional provision that gave the region its autonomy, the government said it was necessary to restore normalcy in India’s only Muslim-majority region. The move triggered a severe security clampdown, mass detentions, curfews and a months-long internet blackout, stripping residents of rights to jobs and land. Since then, Modi and his ministers have extensively talked about a new era of peace and development in Kashmir, announcing projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars that they say are part of a plan to integrate the region's economy with the rest of India. (Until Jammu and Kashmir's special status was removed, outsiders could not buy land to do business there). But locals say they have yet to see the benefits of such projects and continue to struggle with violence and high levels of unemployment. Thousands of Indian army troops continue to be perpetually deployed there, with powers that have led to decades of allegations of human rights violations. ""There is an absence of democracy and freedoms in Kashmir and many political activists remain in jail,"" said political scientist Noor Ahmad Baba. ""The election allows people to give their verdict for or against these changes.""

128,The German woman who helped build an Indian university,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn020ywgx2yo,"The German woman who helped build an Indian university

Family of Muhammad Mujeeb Gerda Philipsborn left her home in Germany to dedicate her life to serving the people of Jamia

In a Muslim graveyard in Delhi, a tombstone stands out. It has an inscription written in the Urdu language, but beneath it lies the name of a German-born Jewish woman - Gerda Philipsborn - followed by the epithet 'Aapajaan' or 'elder sister'. This is an unusual sight as the graves of the founders of Jamia Millia Islamia - a top Muslim university rooted in India's independence movement – rest here. Its students have upheld this legacy of political activism, including protests against a controversial citizenship law introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in 2019. So, how did a German Jew come to be invested in a place so distant and disconnected from her homeland? The answer lies somewhere between friendship and a woman's search for meaning, says Margrit Pernau, author of Jamia's Aapa Jaan: The Many Lifeworlds of Gerda Philipsborn. Pernau, who has spent a decade researching Jamia, says that though she had come across Philipsborn's name several times during her research, her life was shrouded in mystery. Even today, not many students know about Philipsborn and her contribution to the university. Syeda Hameed, a prominent activist and historian, says there's a need for writings on her to be translated and made available to students ""for their benefit and the benefit of future generations"". Philipsborn's journey from being a German memsahib - a term of respect for white European women in colonial India - to becoming Jamia's Aapa Jaan began in 1933 when she traveled to India after forging an unlikely friendship with three Indian men, Zakir Husain, Muhammad Mujeeb, and Abid Husain, who had gone to Berlin to study. The men would go on to become the main founders of Jamia and also play important roles in India's political history, with Zakir Husain becoming the country's third president in 1967.

In the 1920s and 30s, it was uncommon to find cross-national friendships, let alone close, platonic relationships between three men and a woman. The men, who were involved in the freedom movement, often spoke to Philipsborn about their plans to build an institution that would contribute towards India's fight for freedom. At the time, there were very few universities in British India, and even fewer ones that were not funded by the government. The men wanted Jamia to be a place where Muslim boys and girls could educate themselves, so that they could take up an active role in India's freedom struggle. They also wanted the institution to promote unity between Hindus and Muslims and love for the motherland. These altruistic plans had a deep impact on Philipsborn. Born into a wealthy family in 1895, she had seen her life, and the world around her, change due to war, industrialisation and a wave of anti-Semitism. She understood what it felt like to be oppressed, to long for freedom and to be driven by the desire to become an instrument of change, Pernau writes. And so, shortly after her friends left Berlin to dedicate their lives to building Jamia, Philipsborn followed them to India. But moving from a bustling, modernised Berlin to a country mired in poverty was not an easy decision. Pernau sheds light on the many times Zakir Husain forbade Philipsborn from making the journey. ""More than once she had offered to join him [in India], and more than once he had proffered 'advice, warnings, and admonitions not to come',"" Pernau writes. Meanwhile, Muhammad Mujeeb wondered how a ""still young, unmarried and unaccompanied woman would fit into Jamia, whose women at this time still observed purdah [the seclusion of women from the sight of men or strangers, practiced by some Muslims and Hindus],"" she writes. But Philipsborn made the journey despite these calls for caution. Within months, she managed to make friends with the people of Jamia and even began teaching in the university's primary school. Like the rest of the teaches there, she worked for minimal wage and agreed to dedicate her life to serving the institution. She used the knowledge she had gained teaching at kindergartens in Germany to make education enjoyable and approachable for her students. When she was appointed the warden of a hostel for children, she took on the role of an Aapa Jaan for them, Pernau writes. She did menial tasks like washing and oiling their hair and kept them close to her, emotionally and physically. ""When the little children under her care fell sick, she attended to them with such devotion that they didn't miss their mother,"" Pernau says.

Getty Images Muhammad Yunus (centre) took charge as the head of Bangladesh's interim government last month

The relationship between neighbours India and Bangladesh continues to remain frosty more than a month after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted from power. While Hasina’s stay in India remains an irritant, a recent interview by Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus also took India by surprise. The BBC’s Anbarasan Ethirajan examines where ties stand now. Sheikh Hasina was seen as pro-India and the two countries enjoyed close strategic and economic ties during her 15-year rule. Her time in power was also beneficial for India’s security, as she cracked down on some anti-India insurgent groups operating from her country and settled some border disputes. But her presence in India, with no clarity on how long she will stay, complicates the two countries’ efforts to maintain a strong relationship. That was made clearer last week when, in an interview with news agency Press Trust of India, Yunus urged India to stop Hasina from making any political statements while staying in Delhi. “If India wants to keep her until the time Bangladesh wants her back, the condition would be that she has to keep quiet,” said Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who is currently leading an interim administration after Hasina’s exit. Yunus may have been referring to a statement released days after Hasina’s arrival which had stoked anger in Bangladesh. She has not issued any public communication since then. There have been calls within Bangladesh to bring Hasina back to stand trial for killings of people during the anti-government protests in July and August. India’s Bangladesh dilemma: What to do about Sheikh Hasina? Yunus also said in the interview that both countries need to work together to improve their bilateral relationships, which he described as being “at a low”. India’s foreign ministry has not formally reacted yet to the remarks, but officials are reportedly “upset”. “India is waiting and watching developments in Bangladesh, taking note of statements emanating from Dhaka representing both official views and views expressed by prominent individuals,” an Indian official told the BBC on condition of anonymity. Former Indian diplomats say they are taken aback by what has been described as “megaphone diplomacy” by Yunus - trying to discuss contentious bilateral issues through the media.

“India has indicated its readiness to talk to the interim government, and to discuss all concerns, those of Bangladesh and those of India,” Veena Sikri, a former Indian high commissioner in Dhaka, said. The retired diplomat says the issues merit quiet discussions and it’s not clear “on what basis [Yunus] has described the bilateral relationship as low”. But Bangladesh’s foreign ministry rejects the criticism. “Don’t Indian leaders talk to any media? If Dr Yunus is asked about specific issues, he can of course express his views. If you want to criticise, you can criticise about anything,” Touhid Hossain, adviser to the Bangladesh foreign ministry, told the BBC. Though Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Yunus spoke on the telephone some weeks ago, there have been no ministerial level meetings so far. There seems to be a broad consensus in India that Hasina can stay until another country agrees to let her in. However, the newly appointed chief prosecutor of Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal, Mohammad Tajul Islam, has said they are taking steps to extradite her to face charges in connection with the killings during the protests. “As she has been made the main accused of the massacres in Bangladesh, we will try to legally bring her back to Bangladesh to face trial,” Islam told reporters. But experts say it’s unlikely that Hasina will be extradited even if Bangladesh makes a formal request. “She is staying here as a guest of India. If we don’t extend basic courtesy to our long-time friend, then why would anyone take us seriously as a friend in future?” says Riva Ganguly Das, who is also a former Indian high commissioner to Dhaka. In his interview, Yunus also criticised Delhi for not reaching out to Bangladeshi opposition parties. “The narrative is that everybody is Islamist, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is Islamist, and everyone else is Islamist and will make this country into Afghanistan. And Bangladesh is in safe hands with Sheikh Hasina at the helm only. India is captivated by this narrative,” he said. But Indian analysts differ. “I absolutely do not agree with that statement. In Bangladesh, our high commissioners talk to all political parties without ascribing any labels,” says Ms Sikri. During the previous BNP-led coalition government from 2001 to 2006, the bilateral relationship deteriorated, with Delhi accusing Dhaka of harbouring insurgents from India’s north-east. The BNP denies this.
